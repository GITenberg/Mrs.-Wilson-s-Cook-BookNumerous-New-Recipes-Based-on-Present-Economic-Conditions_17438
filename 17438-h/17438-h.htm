<h3>PREFACE</h3>


<p>The influence of well-cooked, palatable food upon the health
and general well-being of the family is as certain as that of
changes of temperature and more serious in its consequences for lasting good or ill.</p>

<p>The sage old saying "Tell me what you eat and I will tell you
what you are" is as full of the "pith o' sense" to-day as in ye days
of long ago, for food either makes us physically fit and fully
efficient, or miserable failures with physical complications that
keep us constantly in the physician's hands.</p>

<p>The vital essences of that which we prepare for eating are
"medicinal messengers" bearing light to the eye, vigor to the limb,
beauty to the cheek and alertness to the brain, as vitamines, or
distorted in the misdirected process are the harsh heralds of pain
and debility to the human system. How great then is the influence
of the one who prepares it!</p>

<p>Influence, according to astrology, was "a power or virtue
flowing from the planets upon men and things," but from the
kitchen, as a sun and heat centre, there truly flows a planetary
influence that makes or mars us.</p>

<p>Scientific cooking means the elimination of waste, the preservation
of edible resources and conservation of their potential energy
through the preparation of attractive, vitalizing food with minimum
cost and labor, thus providing in wide, deep measure, for
harmony, personal comfort and domestic peace.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi" id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>

<p>The preface of a book is too often a flat, spiritless excuse for
offering it to the public instead of being a hearty announcement
in welcome terms of the arrival of a much-desired provision for a
real need, so I will come to the essential point at once by saying
that gathered here, in these pages, are my best recipes, truly "tried
in the fire," the actual working results of many years' teaching
and lecturing, brought "up to the minute" in the interests of that
exacting domestic economy now, as rarely before, imperative in its demands.</p>

<p>It will also be noted that the heavy cook-book style is not
used here but the recipes are presented as if housewife and author
were conversing upon the dish in question, and to her I will say:
economical, palatable food is within your reach if you will discard
the ideas and methods of long ago. Remember, you would not
prefer to ride in a horse car, as a means of conveyance, so why
use the recipes of those days?</p>

<p>The capable housewife, whose busy hands bake bread, cake
and pastry, spreads forth to the community an influence that is
priceless, a largesse not of festal day, holy day, or holiday, but
thrice daily, wholesome and welcome as spring's first sunbeam
and precious to every home so blessed, ever growing and radiating.
May this book help in that growth and a greater radiation!</p>

<h2>MRS. WILSON'S COOK BOOK</h2>


<p>Bread, the staff of life, must be palatable and good if we
are to be satisfied with it when we eat.</p>

<p>Can you think of anything that will spoil a meal more
quickly than poor, over moist, doughy or heavy bread?</p>

<p>Bread may truly be called the staff of life, as it will maintain
life longer than any other single food.</p>

<p>Yet many women think bread-making is a simple task; that
the ingredients can be thrown together helter-skelter and good
results obtained; or that any kind of flour will make good
bread. This is a great mistake. To make good palatable
bread it requires good materials, a reasonable amount of care
and attention. But first of all must come the knowledge of the flour.</p>

<p>A good blend of hard winter flour is necessary and it can
easily be tested by pressing a small quantity of it in the hand;
if the flour is good, it will retain the shape of the hand. Graham
or whole wheat flour and rye flours can be used for variety
and to advantage in making bread.</p>

<p>Other cereal flours do not contain gluten to allow them
to be used alone for making the yeast-raised breads. Keep
this in mind and thus prevent failures. The yeast is a single-cell
plant and must be given the proper temperature, moisture
and food for its successful growth. When this is supplied, each
little cell multiples a thousand times, thus pushing and stretching
the dough. This makes it rise or become light.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>


<h5>WHY DOUGH FALLS</h5>

<p>When the yeast cells have absorbed or consumed all the
food that they can obtain from the sugar, flour, etc., the dough
will recede or fall. Now, if the dough is carefully handled at a
given time, this will not take place, and so for this reason the
dough is permitted to stand only for a given length of time
before it is worked and then placed in the pans.</p>

<p>Few utensils will be required for making bread, but they
must be scrupulously clean, if the bread is to have a good
flavor. Potatoes and other cooked cereals may be used with
good results. Compressed yeast will give the best results, and
either the sponge or straight dough method may be used.</p>

<p>Bread made by the sponge method will require a longer
time to make than the bread that is made by the straight dough
method. Sponge dough consists of setting the sponge and letting
it rise until it drops back, usually in two and one-half
hours, and then adding sufficient flour to make a dough that can easily be handled.</p>

<p>The straight dough method consists of making a dough at
the start. To make bread successfully, do not set the dough
over the range, do not set it on the radiators and do not place
it where it will be in a draft, to rise. Cold chills the dough and
retards the yeast. Yeast grows successfully only in a warm
moist temperature from 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>


<h5>DOUGH BOX</h5>

<p>I would like to tell the housewife about a dough box that I
have found to work very successfully. The baker's success in
making bread is founded on the fact that he can regulate the
temperature of his shop and thus prevent drafts from chilling
the dough. This box is just an ordinary cracker box with the
lid hinged on it. It is then lined with thick asbestos paper on
the inside and then covered with oilcloth on the outside. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
bowl with the dough is then placed in the box to retain its temperature
and to be free from drafts while it rises. In cold
weather this box can be heated by placing a warm iron in it
when starting to mix the dough, and then removing the iron
before placing the dough in the box. This box will easily pay
for the time and cost in a few weeks, and then, too, it will prevent failure.</p>

<p>Now to get the proper temperature&mdash;always use a thermometer.
Remember that you cannot successfully gauge the
correct temperature of liquids that are used for making bread
by testing with the finger or by testing them from the spoon.
Any plain thermometer that can be found in the house will do
for this work. Scrub it with soda and water to remove the paint.
Remember, in cold weather to heat the mixing bowl. See that
the flour is not lower than 65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>All water or half water and milk may be used in making
bread. When the milk is used it must be scalded and then
allowed to cool. Evaporated or condensed milk does not
require scalding. Simply add the hot water to acquire the proper temperature.</p>


<h5>POINTS THAT WILL MAKE FOR SUCCESSFUL BAKING</h5>

<p>Earthen mixing bowls or clean cedar pails make the best
utensils to set the bread dough in. These utensils will retain the
heat and are easy to clean, and when they are closely covered,
prevent a hard crust from forming on the dough.</p>

<p>Do not fail to give the dough plenty of proof&mdash;that is, let it
rise for a sufficient length of time as given in the recipes.</p>

<p>Use a good grade of blended flour.</p>

<p>Use the ball of the hand, near the wrist, to knead and work
the dough. Kneading is most important and should be thoroughly
done. Do not be afraid of hurting the dough; you can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
handle it as roughly as you like. Heavy, active kneading distributes
the yeast organisms and develops the elasticity of the
gluten and gives body and strength to the dough.</p>

<p>Now, a word about the baking. Bread is baked to kill the
fermentation and to hold the glutinous walls of the dough in
place and to cook the starch and thus make it palatable and easy to digest.</p>

<p>An oven 350 degrees Fahrenheit is necessary. Do not have
it any hotter than this. Too much heat browns the loaf before
it has time to bake in the centre.</p>


<h5>SALT</h5>

<p>Salt controls the action of the yeast. It also retards or
delays the proper fermentation if too large an amount of it is
used. Then again, if not enough salt is added to the mix, the
yeast becomes too active and thus produces an overlight loaf of
bread. One ounce of salt to each quart of liquid in summer,
and three-fourths of an ounce in winter will give the best
results to the home baker.</p>


<h5>BAKING THE BREAD</h5>

<p>Now turn on a moulding board and cut into five parts or
loaves. Allow about nineteen ounces to each loaf. Take the
dough up between the hands and work into a round ball. Place
on the moulding board and cover for ten minutes. Now with
the palm of the hand flatten out the dough and then fold halfway
over, pounding well with the hand. Now, take the dough
between the hands and stretch out, knocking it against the
moulding board, fold in the ends and shape into loaves. Place in
well-greased pans and brush the top of each loaf with shortening.
Cover and let raise for 45 minutes. Bake in a hot oven
for 45 minutes and brush with shortening when removing from
the oven. Let cool and then the bread is ready to use.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span>


<h5>SPONGE METHOD</h5>

<p>Generally speaking, the sponge method produces a lighter
and whiter loaf than the bread made by the straight dough
method. Bread made by the straight dough method has the
advantage over bread made by the sponge method in flavor,
texture and keeping qualities.</p>


<h5>SPONGE METHOD</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One quart of water or half water and half milk, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Two yeast cakes,</p>
<p>Two and one-half quarts or two and one-half pounds of flour,</p>
<p>One ounce of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water and add the flour.
Beat to thoroughly blend and then set aside to raise for three hours, then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One ounce of salt,</p>
<p>One and one-half ounces of shortening,</p>
<p>One and one-half quarts or one and one-half pounds of flour.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth elastic dough. This takes usually about
ten minutes, after the flour is worked into the dough. Place
in a greased bowl and then turn over the dough to coat with
shortening. This prevents a crust from forming on the dough.
Set aside to raise for two hours and then pull the sides down
to the centre of the dough and punch down. Turn the dough
over and let raise for one and one-quarter hours.</p>


<h5>THE CARE OF THE BREAD AFTER BAKING</h5>

<p>The jar, crock or box in which the bread is kept should be
scrupulously clean. It should be scalded and aired one day
every week in winter and three times weekly during the spring,
summer and early fall. Keep the fact in mind that the bread
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
kept in a poorly ventilated box will mould and spoil and thus be unfit for food.</p>

<p>Place the freshly baked bread on a wire rack to thoroughly
cool before storing. Do not put old bread in the box with the
new baking. Plan to use the stale bread for toast, dressings,
bread and cabinet puddings, croutons and crumbs.</p>


<h5>THE FOOD VALUE OF BREAD</h5>

<p>Wheat contains the sixteen needed elements for nutrition,
and when made into palatable bread, it forms about 40 per cent.
of our total food requirements. Stale bread digests much easier
than fresh bread for the reason that when thoroughly masticated
in the mouth the saliva acts directly upon the starchy content.
Fresh bread, unless thoroughly chewed, so that it may be well
broken up, becomes a hard, pasty ball in the stomach, which
requires that organ to manufacture the additional gastric juices
to break up this dough ball.</p>

<p>Bread from one to three days old easily digests. Graham
and whole wheat breads contain a larger percentage of nutriment
than the white breads.</p>


<h5>OVEN TEMPERATURE</h5>

<p>Many housewives feel that it is impossible to secure accurate
results in baking in the gas range; this is due to the fact that
few women really understand the principle of baking with gas.</p>

<p>To secure a slow oven, light both burners and let them burn
for five minutes; then turn both of them down low, turning
the handle that controls the flow of gas two-thirds off. This
will maintain a steady even heat. A slow oven requires 250
to 275 degrees Fahrenheit of heat. A moderate oven is 350
to 375 degrees Fahrenheit of heat. It can be obtained by burning
both burners of gas range for eight minutes and then turning
them down one-half to maintain this heat.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>

<p>A hot oven requires 425 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and will
need to have the burners burning twelve minutes and then turned off one-quarter.</p>

<p>This heat is intense and entirely too hot for breads, pastries
and cakes. Meats require this heat for one-half of the length
of time in the period of cooking. This heat is also necessary
for broiling, grilling, etc.</p>

<p>Now, also try to utilize the full oven space when baking
by cooking two or more dishes at the same time. Vegetables
may be placed in casseroles or earthen dishes or even ordinary
saucepans; cover them closely and cook in the oven until tender.
This will not injure other foods baking in the oven.</p>

<p>Do not place breads, cakes and pastries upon the top shelf;
rather, place them on the lower shelf and cook in moderate
oven. Do you know that there are still among us women who
firmly believe that placing other foods to cook in oven with cake
will surely spoil it? This is a mistake; utilize every bit of oven space.</p>

<p>An oven thermometer soon pays for itself. Pay strict attention
to heating the oven; if the oven is too hot, the heat is
wasted, while it cools sufficiently. This wastes gas. When
food is first placed in the oven, keep oven door closed for first
ten minutes and then open when necessary.</p>

<p>Placing food in oven will materially reduce the heat. Do not
try to increase the heat; just as soon as the mixture acquires
the heat, the baking will begin in the usual manner and the dish
will be ready to remove from oven in given time.</p>

<p>Never keep the oven waiting for the food; rather let food
remain in cool place while oven is heating.</p>

<p>Before mixing materials select the pans that will best fit the
oven. This does not mean that you must discard your present
equipment. It means that you should place in groups such pans
that entirely fill oven space without crowding. Keep this fact
in mind when purchasing new utensils.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>

<p>The best and whitest rye flour is milled from the centre of
the grains in a manner similar to wheat flour. When only the
bran is removed from the milling, we have the darker flour,
carrying a heavy pronounced flavor. The rye meal is used
for making pumpernickel, a Swiss and Swedish rye flour bread.</p>


<h5>HOME-MADE YEAST</h5>

<p>Wash four potatoes and then cut in slices, without peeling,
and place in saucepan, and add three pints of water. Cook until
the potatoes are soft and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cupful of hops.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook slowly for one-half hour. Rub the mixture through a
fine sieve and then pour hot mixture on</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cupfuls of flour,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful of salt,</p>
<p>One-quarter cupful of brown sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir until well mixed, beating free from lumps. Cool to 80
degrees Fahrenheit. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One yeast cake dissolved in one cupful of water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir well to mix and then let ferment in a warm place for ten
hours. Now pour into jar or crock and store in a cool place.</p>


<h5>TO USE</h5>

<p>Use one and one-half cups of this mixture in place of the
yeast cake. Always stir well before using and take care that
the mixture does not freeze. This potato ferment must be made
fresh every eighteen days in winter and every twelve days in summer.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>


<h5>STRAIGHT DOUGH VIENNA</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One quart of water or milk,</p>
<p>One ounce of salt,</p>
<p>One ounce of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir well to thoroughly dissolve, and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two yeast cakes,</p>
<p>Four quarts of flour,</p>
<p>One and one-half ounces of shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth dough and then knead for ten minutes.
Then place in a well-greased bowl, turning the dough over
to thoroughly coat. This prevents a crust from forming on the dough.</p>

<p>Cover the bowl and set aside to raise for three and one-half
hours. Now lay over the dough by pulling in toward the centre,
the sides and ends of the dough until it forms a compact mass.
Turn over the dough, cover and let rise for one hour. Now
place on the moulding board and proceed to form into loaves,
using the same method as in the sponge dough.</p>


<h5>TO PREPARE LOAF</h5>

<p>When the dough is ready to mould into loaves, proceed; using
method as given in sponge dough, finally rolling the loaf on
the moulding board, making it pointed at the ends. Now place
a clean cloth in a deep baking pan and sprinkle the cloth with
cornmeal. Place the loaf of dough on the cloth and sprinkle
it lightly with cornmeal. Now lift the cloth up close to the
dough, making a cloth partition between each loaf.</p>

<p>Let the dough rise, about 45 minutes, and when ready to
bake, lift dough carefully from the cloth and lay on a baking
sheet and gash slightly with a sharp knife. Wash with an egg
and water, wash and back forty-five minutes in a hot oven, adding
a small saucepan of boiling water to provide steam to keep
the loaf moist while baking.</p>

<p>One-half of above recipes for small family.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>


<h5>TO MAKE THE FAMOUS FRENCH BREAD</h5>

<p>Pare and cut in slices two medium-sized potatoes. Cook
until very soft in three cups of water. When cooked rub through
a sieve and cool. There must be two cups of this mixture.
When the mixture is about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, pour in the mixing bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One yeast cake crumbled in,</p>
<p>One-half ounce of shortening (1 tablespoon),</p>
<p>One ounce of sugar (2 tablespoons),</p>
<p>Three-fourths ounce of salt (2 teaspoons).</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to thoroughly dissolve and then add eight cups of flour.
Work to a dough and then proceed as in the straight dough
method. When the dough is ready for the pans, cut or divide
into six pieces and mould into loaves, three inches thick and
twelve inches long, and set to rise like the Vienna bread, then
bake, using the same method.</p>


<h5>RYE BREAD</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cupfuls of water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of sugar,</p>
<p>Two teaspoonfuls of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One yeast cake,</p>
<p>Five cupfuls of white flour,</p>
<p>Three cupfuls of rye flour,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a dough and ferment three and one-quarter hours,
then proceed as in the straight dough method. When the dough
is ready for the pans use the same method as for Vienna bread.
Bake in a similar manner, having the oven heated to 450 degrees
Fahrenheit. Rye bread requires an oven hotter than for wheat

<h5>CALIFORNIA ORANGE BREAD</h5>

<p>Grate the rind of two oranges and then place in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of orange juice, warmed to 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of melted shortening,</p>
<p>Four tablespoonfuls of sugar,</p>
<p>One and a half teaspoonfuls of salt,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix and then dissolve one yeast cake in one cup of
water 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and add to the above mixture; then
work in sufficient flour to make a smooth elastic dough; usually
about eight cups. Place in a greased bowl and turn the dough
to thoroughly coat with grease. Cover and let rise for three
hours. Pull the corners of the dough to the centre and punch
down, turn over and let rise again for one hour. Repeat the
punching down and then let rise for three-quarters of an
hour. Turn out on a moulding board and mould into three loaves, adding</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cupful of seeded raisins to one loaf,</p>
<p>One-half cupful of chopped almonds to second loaf,</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>

<p>and keep the third loaf plain. Place in greased pans and let
rise for three-quarters of an hour. Bake in the hot oven for 40
minutes. The temperature of the oven should be 400 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>This bread is delicious for sandwiches. Undoubtedly one
of the causes of the failure in making breads at home is that
the process is hurried and the bread is insufficiently baked.
The size and shape of the pans affect the quality of the bread.
Avoid too deep or shallow pans. A pan, 7&#189; by 4&#188; inches,
will give the best results.</p>

<p>Turn the bread on a wire cake rack to cool. This permits
the free circulation of air.</p>

tops with egg and water; wash and dust lightly with sugar.
Bake for eighteen minutes in a hot oven. A small pan of boiling
water may be placed in the oven when baking these rolls.</p>

<p>For variety's sake, part of the dough may be baked plain.
To the balance add caraway seeds, a little citron, nutmeg or
a few currants. If carefully baked and cooled, these rolls may
be stored in an air-tight box and they will keep for several days.

<h5>STICKY CINNAMON BUNS</h5>

<p>Scald one cup of milk and then place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four tablespoonfuls of shortening,</p>
<p>One-half cupful of sugar,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful of salt</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>in the mixing bowl, and pour over it the scalded milk. Stir to
thoroughly mix and then cool to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Now
dissolve one-half yeast cake in one-half cupful of water 80
degrees Fahrenheit, and when the milk is at the proper temperature,
add six cupfuls of flour and work to a smooth dough.
Place in a well-greased bowl, turning the dough around in the
bowl so that it will be thoroughly coated with shortening.
Cover and let rise three and one-half hours. Now pull the sides
of the dough into the centre and punch down, turning the dough
over. Let rise again for one hour, then turn on a moulding
board and divide the dough in half. Knead each piece into a
ball. Cover and let rise or spring for ten minutes. Now roll
out one-quarter inch thick, using a rolling pin. Brush with
melted shortening and sprinkle well with brown sugar, using
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
about one cupful. Now dust with two teaspoonfuls of cinnamon
and spread over the prepared dough one and one-half cupfuls of
currants or small seedless raisins. Begin at the edge and roll
like a jelly-roll. Cut in pieces one and one-half inches thick
and then place in prepared pans and let rise for one hour.
Then bake in a moderate oven for forty minutes.</p>

<p>To prepare the pan for the cinnamon buns:</p>

<p>Grease the pan very thickly with shortening and then spread
one cupful brown sugar and one-half cupful of currants or small
seedless raisins evenly over the bottom of the pan. Place buns
in pan and let rise for one hour in a warm place, then bake
in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Now for the trick. When the buns are baked, brush the
pastry board with shortening, then place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful of water</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>in a saucepan, mix thoroughly, and then bring to a boil. Now,
just as soon as the buns are baked, turn from the pan at once
and brush well with the prepared syrup, brushing the bottom
with the syrup, as brushing the candied part of the buns prevents
it from hardening. Let cool and then use.</p>


<h5>ST. NAZAIRE BUNS</h5>

<p>Prepare the dough as for cinnamon buns and when ready
to turn on the moulding board add</p>

<p>Work well to distribute the fruit and then form into a long
roll three inches thick. Cut off pieces about one and one-half
ounces and form into buns. Let rest for fifteen minutes and
then roll into round buns and place in a well-greased baking pan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
and let rise for thirty minutes. Make a hole in the centre of
each bun with a small wooden stick and wash the buns with egg
and milk. Bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. Cool,
and then fill the centre with jelly, and ice with water icing.</p>

<h5>CINNAMON CAKE</h5>

<p>You can use part of the dough for cinnamon cake. Cut the
dough into pieces and then roll out three-fourths of an inch
thick. Place in pans, stretching and rolling the dough to fit
pan. Brush with shortening and then cover with crumbs, made as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Six tablespoonfuls of flour,</p>
<p>Four tablespoonfuls of brown sugar,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of shortening,</p>

<h5>COCOANUT ICING</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cupful of confectioner's sugar,</p>
<p>One-half cupful of cocoanut,</p>
<p>Sufficient hot water to moisten.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Spread on the buns with a spatula.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>


<h5>COCOANUT BUNS</h5>

<p>Prepare the dough just the same as for cinnamon buns and
when ready to turn on a moulding board add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cupful of cocoanut,</p>
<p>Three tablespoonfuls of shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Knead to mix and then work the dough into a long roll about
three inches thick and then break into pieces the size of a large
egg. Now mould until round and then let rise on the board
for ten minutes. Mould again, shaping oblong. Place on a
well-greased pan and brush the buns with melted shortening.
Let rise for thirty minutes and then bake in a hot oven and ice with cocoanut icing.</p>


<h5>ALMOND COFFEE CAKES</h5>

<p>Prepare the dough as given in the recipe, using the balance
left for either cinnamon or cocoanut buns. When ready to
turn on a moulding board cut the dough in half and roll each
piece out one-quarter of an inch thick. Spread with shortening
and then lightly with brown sugar and with one-half cupful of
finely shredded almonds or peanuts. Roll like a jelly roll. Press
flat with a rolling pin until just one inch thick. Cut in pieces
six inches long and then place in a well-greased baking pan and
let rise thirty-five minutes. When ready to bake, cut a gash
three inches long on each cake. Wash with egg and milk and
strew with finely shredded almonds. Bake in a moderate oven
for twenty-five minutes. Ice with water icing.</p>


<h5>HOW TO MAKE YEAST-RAISED CAKE</h5>

<p>Scald one cupful of milk and add one-half cupful of cold
water. Cool the mixture to 80 degrees. Now add four tablespoonfuls
of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt. Crumble one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
yeast cake in the mixture and stir thoroughly until the yeast is
dissolved. Now add four cupfuls of sifted flour and beat to a
light batter. Cover, and set in a place free from drafts, where
it will be kept warm in a temperature of 80 degrees and let raise
for three hours. Now beat the dough with a spoon and let raise
again for three-quarters of an hour. Now, while the dough is
raising last time, place one cupful of sugar and one-half cupful
shortening in a bowl and cream until light and frothy. Add two
eggs, one at a time, and beat until very light. When the dough
is ready, add the sugar, eggs, shortening and one and one-half
cupfuls of flour; beat this mixture with spoon for twelve minutes
until thoroughly mixed. Now pour in prepared mould
filling the mould half full. Set in warm place, with a temperature
of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, to raise for one and one-quarter
hours or until the mixture fills the mould. Bake in a moderate
oven for three-quarters of an hour.</p>

<p>Remove the cake from the mould and cool on a wire rack.
This cake may be iced or served plain; or chopped nuts, raisins
or citron may be added to the dough with the sugar and eggs.</p>

<p>To prepare the pans: Grease them thoroughly, then coat
them with finely chopped nuts or fine cake crumbs before pouring in the dough.</p>


<h5>BRIOCHE</h5>

<p>Brioche is a French sweet bread and while different authorities
do not agree as to both the consistency and methods, without
doubt these cakes figure largely in French cuisines.</p>

<p>One French bakery prepares the brioches in loaf form and
when cold it is cut in slices and steeped in orange syrup. Then
again the brioche is spread with jam and then covered with
icing or the brioche may be steeped with prepared syrup and
then dipped in a batter and fried golden brown in hot fat.
Spread with jam and serve with orange or lemon sauce.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>

<p>The actual preparation of the brioche involves very little
trouble and can be made from bread dough on baking day. Now
one point in making these sweet breads&mdash;there is just the same
trick as in moulding the loaf of bread. One can learn by careful
attention to details and with practice. Some stress may well be
laid upon the lightness of the dough; for heavy, overrich dough
that is poorly baked is injurious to health.</p>


<h5>WATER ICING</h5>

<p>Six tablespoonfuls of confectioner's sugar and sufficient
water (boiling) to moisten.</p>


<h5>BREST BREAD</h5>

<p>Roll the dough into three strands about one inch thick and
ten inches long. Fasten the three strands together and then
braid. Place on a well-greased pan and let rise. Wash with
egg and milk and then bake for twenty-five minutes in a moderate
oven. Spread with jelly and then ice with water icing. Sprinkle
with slightly browned cocoanut.</p>


<h5>TO MAKE BRIOCHE USING BREAD DOUGH</h5>

<p>When the bread is ready to put in the pan cut off one
pound and place the dough in a bowl. Now place in a separate bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Work or knead until smooth and elastic. Place in a greased
bowl and let rise for three hours; now turn on board, divide
into eight pieces and mould into balls. Cover and let rise for ten
minutes. Now roll out one-half inch thick. Brush with shortening,
strew with brown sugar and nuts. Roll like jelly roll and
then flatten well with rolling pin. Place in a greased pan, cover
and let rise for one-half hour. Now cut down the entire length of
the dough, leaving two inches on each end. Wash with egg wash
and bake twenty minutes in hot oven. Sprinkle with sugar, then
return to oven five minutes.</p>


<h5>SWEET DOUGHS</h5>

<p>In the days of long ago, yeast, ammonia, pearl ash, honey
water and a treacle mixture were used to lighten cakes&mdash;before
the time of dependable baking powder.</p>

<p>In Europe the housewife makes from bread dough delicious
cakes with yeast. These provide splendid variety. They include
savarins, babas, and yeast-raised fruit cakes.</p>

<p>Many women fail in making these delicious goodies because
they do not realize that the addition of large amounts of sugar,
fruit, shortening and eggs to yeast dough, unless carefully
handled, is apt to produce heavy, moist cakes that lack the light,
velvety texture which makes cake a success.</p>

<p>The addition of nuts, cake crumbs and fruit will afford a large variety.</p>

<p>A sponge dough is necessary for successful results.</p>


<h5>RUSSIAN RUSK</h5>

<p>Prepare the dough as for brioche, adding one cupful of finely
shredded almonds when ready to mould for the pan. Use a long
narrow pan to bake loaf in. When baked, cool and then cut in
one-inch slices and toast light brown in the oven.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>


<h5>SPANISH BUN</h5>

<p>Scald one cupful of milk and then cool to 80 degrees Fahrenheit
and pour in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three tablespoonfuls sugar,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoonful salt,</p>
<p>One yeast cake dissolved in four tablespoonfuls cool water,</p>
<p>Three cupfuls of flour.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat for five minutes with a spoon and let rise for two hours. Now cream</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-quarter cupfuls sugar,</p>
<p>One-half cupful of shortening</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>until very light and creamy and then drop in, one by one, three
eggs, beating the eggs for three minutes. Add this to the yeast-raised
dough, together with one cupful of sifted flour. Beat
with a wooden spoon for fifteen minutes and then pour into a
greased and floured pan, filling the pan half full. Put the
raisins on the top and then cover and let rise until it fills the
pan almost to the edge. Bake in a moderate oven for fifty-five
minutes and then cool and ice.</p>


<h5>BABAS</h5>

<p>Prepare dough as for brioche and, when ready to pan, mould
into loaf shape adding nuts and finely shredded citron. Place
in well-greased Boston brown-bread mould; let rise for one hour.
Bake in moderate oven forty-five minutes. Then begin to baste
the Baba with syrup made from</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cupful syrup,</p>
<p>One-half cupful water,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful vanilla,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful mace.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook syrup ten minutes before using to baste the Baba, and
bake until the syrup is absorbed, then turn on plate.</p>

<h5>ANISE SEED RUSK</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoonful of anise seed,</p>
<p>One-half cupful finely shredded citron.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Add the above ingredients to the brioche dough; mould and
bake as for Russian rusk. These crisp slices will keep for a
long time if placed in an air-tight box.</p>

<p>This dough may be used for the old English crull cakes,
which is nothing more than a doughnut. Prepare a dough as for
a brioche and when ready for the pans turn on a molding board.
Roll out one-quarter inch thick; cut with doughnut cutter. Set
on cloth to rise for fifteen minutes. Stretch to shape and fry
in hot fat until golden brown. Roll in pulverized sugar and cinnamon.</p>

<p>These doughs may be moulded in wreaths, crescents and
bowknots. When risen, wash with egg wash, then sprinkle with
granulated sugar and chopped nuts and then bake in moderate oven.</p>


<h5>INDIAN GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cupful cornmeal,</p>
<p>One cupful flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful salt,</p>
<p>Three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of syrup,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful shortening,</p>
<p>One egg,</p>
<p>One and one-quarter cups of milk.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard to mix and then bake on a hot griddle.</p>


<h5>GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<p>To bring the true nut flavor from the buckwheat we must
go back to old-fashioned method of setting the buckwheat to
rise overnight. Don't you remember the brownstone crock that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
was kept in the pantry and each time it was left with just
enough of the mixture to start a new batter? The buckwheat
would be prepared each night just before bedtime, and in the
morning a cup of warm water was added, together with a couple
of tablespoonfuls of syrup. The mixture was beaten and then
the griddle was put on to heat. Sometimes it was a soapstone
or a heavy iron griddle. When well heated it was rubbed with
a piece of cut turnip or potato. The batter was poured on in
large platter-sized cakes and then as quickly as they browned
they were dexteriously turned to brown again.</p>

<p>To make perfect buckwheat cakes you must first of all obtain
a stone-ground flour, and then it must be blended in proportion.
Good, lively yeast is added, and if milk is used for the mixing
it must be scalded and then cooled before using. To prepare
the flour for the mixing:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three pounds of buckwheat flour,</p>
<p>One and one-half pounds of wheat flour,</p>
<p>One pound of corn flour,</p>
<p>One ounce of salt,</p>
<p>One-half ounce of baking soda.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift twice to thoroughly mix and then place in a dry container
and the flour is then ready to use.</p>


<h5>BUCKWHEAT CAKES</h5>

<p>Scald and then rinse out with cold water a large stone crock.
Pour in one cupful of scalded and cooled milk and</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cupfuls of water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Crumble in one-half of an yeast cake and stir until dissolved,
then add three cupfuls of the prepared buckwheat flour.
Beat to thoroughly mix and then cover and set aside overnight to
rise. In the morning add sufficient lukewarm water to bring the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
mixture to a pouring consistency. This usually requires about
one cupful. Add two tablespoonfuls of syrup. Beat hard for
three minutes and then let stand in a warm place while the
griddle is heating, then bake.</p>


<h5>RICE GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<p>Rice griddle cakes may be prepared as follows: Wash one-half
cup of rice in plenty of water and then place in a saucepan
and add three cupfuls of water. Cook until the water is absorbed
and the rice is soft. Let cool. Now place in a crock</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two and one-half cupfuls water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls sugar,</p>
<p>One-half yeast cake.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir until dissolved and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The prepared rice,</p>
<p>Three cupfuls white flour,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoonful baking soda.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix and then cover and set aside to rise overnight.
In the morning add sufficient lukewarm water to make a pouring
batter, adding two tablespoonfuls of syrup and one teaspoonful
of salt. Beat very hard and then set in a warm place while the griddle is heating.</p>

<p>The use of a small amount of baking soda as given in above
recipes is for the purpose of neutralizing the slightly acid flavor
of the buckwheat&mdash;a flavor to which many folks object.</p>

<p>Either of above mixes may be baked in a waffle iron instead
of using the griddle. Try it some morning for the sake of
variety. Use salad oil in a new sewing-machine oil can to grease waffle iron.</p>

<p>Almost everyone loves good sweet butter on the hot cakes
in the morning. At the present prices of butter the frugal
housewife looks upon the fast disappearing pat of butter with
alarm. Now try this and save the butter and yet give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
folks the butter flavor upon their cakes; place two tablespoonfuls
of butter in a pitcher which will hold a cupful of syrup. Add
the syrup and then place the pitcher in a pan of warm water
and set on the stove to heat. Beat constantly until the butter
melts and produces a creamy mix.</p>

<p>Stale bread may be crumbled or soaked in cold water pressed
dry and used in place of rice or cornmeal. So may oatmeal or
other leftover breakfast cereals, as well as mashed potatoes, be
used. Reserve about one cupful of the yeast batter to start the
next batter. Use this starter in place of the yeast. Renew the
yeast mix every fifth morning.</p>

<p>A word about the griddle may not come amiss. The old-fashioned
iron or soapstone may be used and will give good
results. Aluminum griddles do not require greasing.</p>


<h5>BREAD GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<p>Try these cakes some morning when the folks are tired of the
usual breakfast dishes. Place in a pitcher overnight</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of buttermilk or sour milk,</p>
<p>One cup of water,</p>
<p>Two cups of bread crumbs.</p>

<p>Let stand in the kitchen in a cool place. Do not put in the
icebox. In the morning add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One teaspoonful baking soda</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>dissolved in</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three tablespoonfuls of water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard to mix and then bake on a hot griddle.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>


<h5>CORNMEAL GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<p>Scald one cup of cornmeal with two cups of boiling water,
and then let cool. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cupfuls water, 80 degrees Fahrenheit,</p>
<p>Three tablespoonfuls of syrup,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful of salt,</p>
<p>One-quarter yeast cake,</p>
<p>Two cupfuls flour,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoonful baking soda.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard and then let rise overnight; then prepare as for buckwheat cakes.</p>

<p>Modern methods have eliminated the yeast and substituted
baking powder, thus making a quicker mix. To prepare buckwheat
cakes with baking powder, prepare a blend of flour as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two pounds of buckwheat,</p>
<p>One pound of wheat flour,</p>
<p>One cupful cornmeal,</p>
<p>One ounce of salt,</p>
<p>Three ounces of baking powder,</p>
<p>One-quarter ounce baking soda.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift three times to mix and then place in a dry container and use as required.</p>


<h5>HOW TO BAKE THE PANCAKE</h5>

<p>Use a frying-pan that is perfectly flat; the iron ones are
best, as they hold the heat longer and can be regulated so that
the cake will not burn.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>


<h5>PANCAKES FOR TWO</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>One teaspoonful vanilla or nutmeg,</p>
<p>One and one-quarter cupfuls flour,</p>
<p>Two level teaspoonfuls baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in a bowl. Beat with a Dover egg-beater to thoroughly
mix and then fold in the stiffly beaten white of egg. Pour the
mixture into a pitcher and then place two tablespoonfuls of
shortening in a frying pan. When smoking hot pour in just
sufficient batter to cover the bottom of the pan. When it begins
to bubble turn the cake over and bake on the other side. Lift
and spread lightly with jelly or roll, or use the following mixture:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

the hot lid and invert, returning the cake to the pan. Spread
with sugar and cinnamon. Bar le duc or currant jelly may be
used to spread on the cakes. Fold like an omelet and place
a spoonful of jelly on top. Serve. This will make two large pancakes.</p>

<h5>BELGIUM PANCAKES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cupfuls of unsweetened thin applesauce,</p>

<p>Three tablespoonfuls syrup,</p>
<p>Two and one-half cupfuls flour,</p>
<p>Three teaspoonfuls baking powder,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful shortening,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoonful cinnamon.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix and then bake in the usual manner. Serve with butter and syrup.</p>


<h5>WAFFLES</h5>

<p>Waffles are made from a thin batter and are baked in a
well-heated waffle iron. Many failures to make good waffles are
due to the fact that the iron is not sufficiently hot. The iron
must be thoroughly cleaned after each baking. Place the iron
on the range to heat, turning it several times.</p>

<p>Try this method in greasing the iron. Purchase a large-sized
sewing machine oil-can, wash well in plenty of hot water
and soap, then rinse thoroughly and dry. Now fill with a
good salad oil and when the iron is heated, oil it on both sides.
Now you are ready to bake the waffles. Reverse the iron, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
the hot side on top, and pour in the batter and then bake about
three minutes, reversing the iron once.</p>

<p>When the waffles are baked remove from the iron and then oil
and reverse it again, putting the side that was next to the
fire on top and then pour in the batter, close and bake as before.</p>


<h5>QUICK BREADS</h5>

<p>Quick breads include griddle cakes, waffles, muffins, Sally
Lunns, shortcakes and biscuits. These doughs are made light
or leavened by the use of eggs, baking soda, baking powder and
steam created in baking and by air beaten into the mixture.
Their entire success depends upon the careful measurement of
ingredients, the mixing and the baking. Using all water in place
of milk or equal parts of milk and water will give splendid results.</p>


<h5>GRIDDLE CAKES</h5>

<p>Place the griddle on the range to heat slowly, while mixing the batter.</p>

<p>Place in a bowl or a flat, wide-mouthed pitcher</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cupful milk,</p>
<p>One cupful water,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful salt,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful syrup,</p>
<p>Two and one-half cups of flour,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls shortening,</p>
<p>Four level teaspoonfuls baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix to a smooth batter. This amount of batter will
make hotcakes for four persons. For larger amounts, multiply.
One egg may be used for every two cupfuls of flour.</p>

<p>Test the griddle by dropping a few drops of water on it;
if the water boils, the griddle is sufficiently hot to bake with.
Aluminum griddles do not require any grease. Rub with a
clean cloth dipped in salt. Grease iron griddles slightly. Pour
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
on the batter; just as soon as the cakes begin to form air
bubbles slip a cake-turner under the cakes and turn them.</p>

<p>Now, if large bubbles rise at once to the top of the cakes,
the griddle is too hot and the heat should be reduced; while,
if the cake stiffens before the underside is brown the griddle is
not hot enough. Never turn a griddle cake twice&mdash;this makes
them heavy. Serve them as soon as baked, piling not more than
five or six together. Sour milk may be used in place of sweet
milk. Discard the baking powder and use one level teaspoonful
of baking soda for each cup of sour milk. One egg and two
cupfuls of water may be used in place of two cupfuls of milk.</p>


<h5>WAFFLE BATTER</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of milk,</p>
<p>One cup of water,</p>

<p>Three teaspoonfuls baking powder,</p>
<p>One tablespoonful syrup,</p>
<p>Two tablespoonfuls shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to a smooth batter in a wide-mouthed pitcher. One-half
of this amount for two people.</p>

<p>Cold boiled rice, hominy, oatmeal and stale bread that has
been soaked in cold water and then pressed dry and rubbed
through a sieve may be added to the griddle cakes and waffle batters.</p>


<h5>MUFFINS</h5>

<p>Muffins are made from a drop batter and may be baked in
rings, on a griddle, in muffin pans or in custard cups. To bake
the muffins in rings on a griddle upon the top of the stove&mdash;grease
the griddle well, and also have the rings well greased. Put
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
the griddle on to heat when starting to mix the drop batter
and keep the rings cool until ready to bake.</p>

<p>Place in a bowl or pitcher</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cupfuls of milk or equal parts of milk and water,</p>

<p>Beat this mixture smooth and then place the rings on a hot
griddle and half fill with the drop batter. When well risen and
nearly dry, turn over, using the griddle-cake turner to turn the
muffins and rings. Bake on the other side. It will require
about eighteen minutes to bake these muffins. Tear them apart,
butter and serve them at once.</p>

<h5>IRISH SCONES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of mashed potatoes,</p>
<p>Three cups of sifted flour,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>Two level teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>Three level teaspoons of shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now place in a bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of milk,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat. Use about two-thirds of the egg and milk mixture to
form a dough. Knead the dough to a smooth mixture and then
divide into four parts. Pat or roll out like a saucer and then
make two cuts to form the cross, cutting into four pieces. Brush
with part of egg and milk mixture and then place on a baking
sheet and bake in a hot oven for eighteen minutes.</p>


<h5>POPOVERS</h5>

<p>Place the popover pan in the oven to heat. When hot start
to mix the batter. Place in a measuring cup one egg, then fill

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of sifted flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of sugar,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat with egg-beater until the mixture is a mass of bubbles
on top, when the egg-beater is removed. This usually takes about
five minutes. Now grease the hot popover pan well and fill
one-half full with the batter. Place in a hot oven and bake for
thirty-five minutes. Do not open the oven door for ten minutes
after you put the popovers in. Opening the door before this
period of time elapses prevents the mixture from springing
or popping. After twenty minutes turn down the heat to
moderate oven to prevent burning and to dry out the centres.</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>in a bowl; beat to mix. Use this to form the dough, roll out one-half
inch thick, cut and fry golden brown in hot fat.</p>


<h5>HOW TO FRY CRULLERS OR DOUGHNUTS</h5>

<p>When ready to fry place four cups of vegetable oil in a
pan. The pan should not be too large and the fat should be
deep enough to allow the cruller to swim at least two and one-half
inches from the bottom of the pan.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>


<h5>GOLDEN BROWN</h5>

<p>Heat the fat and test before starting to cook by dropping
in a small piece of the dough and starting to count 101, 102,
104 and so on until 110 is reached. The sample should now be
floating on top and a light brown in color. Do not attempt to
start frying before this time, as the fat will not be sufficiently
hot and the crullers will soak up the grease. Drop four or five
doughnuts in the hot fat at a time, turning constantly, and
cook until golden brown, lift, let drain few seconds, lay on
paper towelling and then roll in sugar and cinnamon.</p>

<h5>FRUIT CAKE</h5>

<p>A handsome and rich fruit cake is usually the accepted
cake for weddings and anniversaries. In the days of long ago
the young women of the household delighted to show their skill
in the making and baking of this queen of cakes. In those days
folks felt that it was an indispensable feature of the feast, and
the reveler of to-day holds it in equal esteem as did his grandad
before him. Here is an old and treasured recipe:</p>

<p>Place one glass of spiced jam in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of cocoa,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of cinnamon,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of nutmeg,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of vanilla extract.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to thoroughly mix and then spread over the cake. Set
the cake in a deep aluminum saucepan or stone crock and put
in a warm room to ripen, until just before Christmas. Then
remove the cake from the crock and wipe with a cloth which has
been wrung very dry from hot water, then ice with chocolate icing.</p>

<h5>RUMANIAN FRUIT CAKE</h5>

<p>This is the richest cake made in Europe during the holiday
season and is usually for royalty. The original recipe came to
me in a form that is much too large for the ordinary family,
so I have divided the proportions so that even the thrifty
housewife may feel she can afford this one extravagance. The recipe follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of honey,</p>
<p>One cup of brown sugar,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of good shortening,</p>

<p>Yolks of three eggs.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cream together and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half pint cup of spiced jam,</p>
<p>One-half pint cup of any kind of jelly.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat again to blend and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Six cups of sifted flour,</p>
<p>Tour tablespoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of strong black coffee.</p>

beaten whites of three eggs and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Mix in the fruit well and then grease and flour a round
pudding pan and line with three thicknesses of greased and
floured paper. Pour in the cake mixture and cover the top of
the cake with a well-greased paper. Now set the pan containing
the cake in a large baking pan, which contains about three cups
of boiling water. Place in a slow oven and bake for two and
one-half hours. Remove and let cool and then turn from
the pan and brush the paper with boiling water to remove. Now to ripen or age.</p>

<h5>WHITE POUND CAKE</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four ounces of butter,</p>
<p>One and one-half cups of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cream until light and frothy, and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cupful of milk,</p>
<p>Three and one-half cupfuls of flour,</p>
<p>Four teaspoonfuls of baking powder,</p>
<p>One teaspoonful of almond extract,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoonful of mace.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat for five minutes to blend and then cut and fold in the
stiffly beaten whites of five eggs. Bake in prepared pans for
one hour in a moderate oven. Use the pans prepared the same
as for the fruit cake. Golden cake may be made from this
recipe, using the yolks of seven eggs.</p>

<p>To use successfully you must use good shortening, pastry
flour, granulated sugar and fresh eggs. Exact care in measuring
with the proper methods of compounding and finally careful
baking are necessary. Now for another point: do not stir
the cake after its final beating.</p>

<p>In filling the cake pan put the mixture well into the corners
and leave a slight depression in the centre. This will leave the
cake perfectly smooth on top. Now, if the oven is too cool when
the cakes go into it the cake will rise over the top of the pans
and become coarse-grained. While, on the other hand, if it is
too hot it will brown quickly on the top before the cake has had
a chance to rise; then when the dough does attempt to rise it
will break through and crack the crust. Too much flour will also
cause this. Now to break the old hoodoos about cake-baking!
You may look at the cake after it is in the oven ten minutes if
you will open and shut the oven door gently, and if necessary
to remove the cake wait until it has reached its full height and
is beginning to brown. Then it may be removed carefully without
danger of falling. Sometimes it may be necessary to
remove the cakes so that they may brown evenly. Icing the cakes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
greatly improves their appearance. Should the cake for any
reason scorch, don't trim it with a knife. This spoils its appearance;
instead use a grater and remove the scorched part.</p>

<p>Turn the cakes to cool upon a sieve or wire cake-rack.
Do not attempt to ice a cake until it is cool and then coat the
entire cake over with a plain water icing.</p>

<h5>PASTRY</h5>

<p>Now it all rests with the cook as to whether we are going to
have a cut of pastry that fairly melts in your mouth or a tough
doughy mass that is unfit for food.</p>

<p>Any little housewife may turn out delicious, flaky pastry
if she will but follow directions carefully. First of all, let us
study for a minute just what pastry is. It is a mixture of
flour, shortening and water. Each grain of flour is thoroughly
coated with shortening and then mixed to a dough with the
water. Do I hear you say "Well I know that?" Surely you
do. But do you know the real knack of putting it together?
For here is the real rub. The minute you knead or squeeze
pastry that is the moment you make it tough.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>


<h5>THE REAL SECRET</h5>

<p>Sift</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Three teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>together twice, and then cut or rub into this two-thirds cup of
shortening. If you cut it in, use your griddle-cake turner or
spatula and chop it in rather coarse. Now mix to a dough
with one-half cup of ice-cold water, using the cake-turner to
mix the water in; just keep chopping and turning over until
the mixture is formed into a ball of dough. Do not knead or
pat with the hand. You cannot hurt this dough if you will
just mix it as a man does when mixing mortar with a hoe. Keep
working it back and forth, chopping it each time until well
mixed. This amount will make the tops and the bottoms for two pies.</p>

<p>To roll the dough, divide it into four parts and then lift
one piece on a slightly floured board and roll out the dough,
working the rolling pin to and from you and turning the dough
as often as necessary to secure the size and shape desired.</p>

<p>Should the dough tear, or not come to the desired shape,
just fold it into squares or oblongs and then roll again.</p>

<p>Place on the tin and then trim the edges. Proceed in the
same manner with the top crust, and then when ready to place
on the pie, fold from corner to corner, making a bias fold and
then cut quarter-inch gashes with a knife in centre to allow
steam to escape. Lift and cover the pie and then trim to shape.
Now do not form the trimmings into a ball, but lay them one
piece upon the other in a pile and flatten them with the rolling
pin. Roll and fold into shape, and roll as desired.</p>

<p>You can re-roll pastry as often as desired by this method.
Keep in the mind the fact that kneading or squeezing the pastry
forms it into a sticky mass. This method will give you a delicious,
flaky crust. You may spread two tablespoons of shortening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
upon the top crust and then fold and roll. Fold again
and roll; then use as desired.</p>

<p>Sufficient pastry may be made at one time to last for two
or three days. Just wrap the dough in wax-paper so that it
does not dry out. Various fillings may be used. Fresh or
canned fruits, custards, mince meat, etc. If you use fresh fruits place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of sugar,</p>
<p>Three level tablespoons of cornstarch,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>in a bowl and rub between the hands to thoroughly mix and
then use this by sprinkling over the fruit. This will prevent
the juice from boiling out of the pie while it is cooking and it
will form into a jelly when cold.</p>

<p>To use canned fruit, drain the fruit free from the liquid
and then cut into thin slices. Measure the liquid and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four level tablespoons of cornstarch,</p>
<p>Eight tablespoons of sugar,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>to each cupful. Dissolve the starch and sugar in the cold liquid
and then bring to a boil. Cook for three minutes and then add
the prepared fruit. Cool before placing in the pastry.</p>

<p>To prevent the lower crust from becoming soggy just before
putting in the filling, brush it well with a good salad oil, or
shortening, taking care that each part is covered. This will
give you a tender, flaky lower crust.</p>

<p>Just before the pie is ready to put into the oven brush it
well with a wash of egg and milk, using</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yolk of one egg,</p>
<p>One-half cup of milk,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to dissolve the sugar and mix in the egg. Then wash
the pie. This will keep a week in a cool place.</p>

<p>The correct temperature to bake a pie is 300 to 350 degrees
Fahrenheit. This means a moderate oven. Too much heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
will brown the crust before the filling inside has had the time
to cook. Custard pies&mdash;this includes those made of eggs, milk,
lemon meringes, sweet potato and pumpkin&mdash;require a slow
oven&mdash;250 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>


<h5>PASTRY FOR CUSTARD PIE</h5>

<p>The most important point in the custard pie is the crust,
which will either make or mar the pie. So to begin with, the
pastry should be light and delicate. To make pastry for custard pie place in a bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Three teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift to mix and then rub in one-half cup of good shortening,
and then mix to a dough with one-half cup of ice water. When
mixing the pastry to a dough, it is important that it should
be cut and folded together much after the method used in cutting
and folding the whites into a cake. Care at this point in
making the pastry will prevent it from becoming tough. Now
wrap the pastry in wax or parchment paper and place on the
ice to thoroughly chill for two hours. Now if the pastry is
made either the day before or early in the morning and then
allowed to blend, it will be delightfully light and flaky.</p>

<p>Now to prepare for the pie: This amount of pastry will
be sufficient for two large pies, one custard and one lemon, for
variety. The trimmings can be made into little tarts, turnovers
or cheese straws. Divide the pastry into two parts and then
roll out one part on a lightly floured board until sufficiently
large to fully cover the pie tin.</p>

<p>Now fold carefully in half and then in quarters and lift
on the pie plate and open covering the pie plate, easing on the
pastry. Trim the edges and then roll out the trimmings into a
long narrow strip. Cut into strips three-quarters inch wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
and then brush the edge of the pastry on the pie plate with
water and add this narrow strip as a reinforcement to build up
the edge. This will prevent the custard overflowing.</p>

<p>Now brush the pastry in the bottom of the pie plate with
melted shortening, taking care to thoroughly coat the entire
surface with the shortening. Then pour in the prepared custard.
Reserve about one tablespoon of the custard to brush
the pastry around the edges. Place in a slow oven and bake
until the custard is firm in the centre.</p>

<p>To test if custard is baked, gently insert a silver knife into
the custard, taking care that the knife does not pierce the crust.</p>

<p>Brushing the pastry with the shortening before pouring in
the custard prevents the moisture from soaking into the crust.</p>


<h5>TO MAKE THE MERINGUE</h5>

<p>Beat the whites of two eggs in a bowl, which is free from
grease, until stiff, and then cut and fold into the stiffly beaten
whites of the two eggs</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of pulverized sugar,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of cornstarch.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift the sugar and cornstarch to thoroughly mix and then
carefully cut and fold into the whites of eggs.</p>

<p>On just how careful you are in cutting and folding this
mixture will determine the success of your meringues. After
the whites are beaten stiff they are full of little air bubbles,
which if stirred break down and become watery and then the
entire mixture becomes flat and tough. To prevent this, sprinkle
the prepared sugar over the stiffly beaten white of egg and
then with a spoon cut down through the centre and fold over;
turn the bowl half-way around, then cut and fold again. Repeat
this until sufficiently mixed, then place on the hot pie, sprinkle
with granulated sugar and place in the oven to brown. Open
the oven door and let stand for a few minutes, then remove
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>
to a place free from drafts where it will cool slowly, so as to
prevent a sudden shrinking of the meringue, due to a sudden chill.</p>

<p>To make cocoanut pie, add one-half cup of cocoanut to the
custard pie just before putting in the oven.</p>


<h5>PEACH CUSTARD PIE</h5>

<p>Crush a sufficient number of pared peaches to measure one
cup. Place in a mixing bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to dissolve and then bring to a boil. Cook for two
minutes and then pour very slowly, while beating hard to blend,
on the peaches and sugar that are blending in the mixing bowl.</p>

<p>Add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yolks of two eggs,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of cinnamon.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<h5>SHORTCAKE</h5>

<p>The shortcake is typical of Scotland. It is a mixture of
flour, sugar and shortening worked to a paste and then rolled
one-half inch thick and then decorated in various ways. The
thrifty Scotsman, after leaving the mother country and settling
in the new America, felt that the use of much shortening was
too expensive, and so his thrifty housewife, who was willing
and even anxious to be a partner to him, co&#246;perated by cutting
down on the amount of shortening and still turn out a rich
palatable cake. This is how she does it: Place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of flour,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two level tablespoons of sugar,</p>
<p>Two level tablespoons of baking powder,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>in a bowl and sift three times. Now rub in six tablespoons of
shortening and then add seven tablespoons of water and work
to a smooth elastic dough. Turn on a prepared pastry board
and mould into shape to fit the pie tin with the hands. Wash
the top of the dough with milk and sprinkle with sugar and

<h5>RICE</h5>

<p>Rice is extensively cultivated in the Orient and supplies
the principal food to nearly one-half the population of the entire
world. There is every reason why rice should be a daily article
of diet in planning the menu. It is more nutritious than the
potato and it digests more readily. When properly cooked
and served it is an ideal starchy food.</p>

<p>Unpolished rice contains all the nutritions of the grains,
which is approximately 6 per cent. fat, 8 per cent. protein,
79 per cent. carbohydrates. The polished variety contains
an average of 88 per cent. nutrition. Polished rice has been
robbed of its vital life-giving elements.</p>

<p>Rice is graded for size and condition and then prepared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
for the trade. It is known as fancy head rice, choice, prime,
good, medium, common and screenings. Patna rice, the small
slender, well-rounded grain, is in great demand in the East,
with the Japan, Siam, Java, Rangoon, and Passein varieties
closely following. In this country the Carolina, Japan and
Honduras are popularly in demand.</p>

<p>The Carolina rice is a large sweet-flavored grain of good
color and appearance. Japanese rice is a thick-bodied, soft-grained
variety. Honduras variety is the slender, well-shaped grain.</p>

<p>The preparation of rice for the markets involves, first, the
threshing, and second, the milling, which removes the husks, and,
third, the polishing to produce the pearly white gloss which
so many folks think is very desirable.</p>

<p>Polished rice has been robbed of nearly all its fat and mineral
content, and thus its food value is lowered and it is deprived of its flavor.</p>

<p>The rice dishes, as prepared in the Oriental countries, are
made from fancy unpolished head rice and they form some of the main dishes.</p>

<p>The Oriental first washes his rice in several waters, rubbing
it vigorously between the hands. This thoroughly cleanses it.
Now, to follow this method, have a saucepan containing boiling
water and then add the rice slowly, so that the water continually
boils. Cook until tender and then remove the lid from
the saucepan and cover the rice with a cloth to absorb the
moisture. Set in a warm place for five minutes. This will give
the saucepan containing a mass of delicious, fluffy rice, each
grain distinct and separate.</p>

<p>Now, if you carefully measure both your rice and then the
water, it will not be necessary for you to drain off the excess
water and thus lose the valuable mineral and fat content.</p>

<h5>HOW TO COOK RICE AMERICAN STYLE</h5>

<p>Place in a double boiler two and one-half cups of boiling
water and then add one teaspoon of salt. Now add slowly one-half
cup of well-washed, unpolished rice. Cover and cook until
the rice is tender and the water absorbed. Remove the lid and
then cover the rice closely with a clean napkin and cook for
five minutes. This will fluff each grain of rice.</p>

<p>It is now ready to serve, either as a vegetable to replace the
potato or prepared into many delectable dishes that our Oriental
neighbors relish so keenly.</p>

<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of butter, broken into tiny balls.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bake in a slow oven for one hour and stir two or three times.</p>

<p>The cultivation of rice in Louisiana is more than a hundred
years old. Louisiana now produces a crop of this cereal larger
than the entire crop of the states of Georgia and Carolina.
The tourist who visits Louisiana during the time of the rice
market enjoys a scene that is rarely duplicated elsewhere in
the civilized world; for here are gathered the buyers from all parts of the country.</p>

<p>The Creole of Louisiana, like the Oriental, has the true
secret for making this food a palatable article of diet. The
old mammy in New Orleans always tells her children that, of
course, le riz must be thoroughly washed and she always
insists that the grains be cleansed in four waters&mdash;two warm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>
and two cold&mdash;and then it is cooked in the same manner as the Orientals use.</p>

<p>Never stir the rice while it is cooking; this will make it
mushy. Instead, always shake the sauce-pan. Never flood
the rice with water while it is cooking. Always keep the fact
in mind that just five times the actual measurements of the rice
in water will be required to cook it.</p>

<p>In this way there will be no excess water to drain off. So if
you are using one-quarter cup of rice you would use one and
one-quarter cups of water. Now you cannot pile up the water;
you must be accurate in measuring the rice.</p>

<p>Boiled rice is a delicious accompaniment to chicken, lamb,
turkey, shrimp, crabs and lobster&mdash;with okra and for oyster,
chicken and crab grumbo; as a vegetable to replace potatoes
and as a border for stews, goulashes, etc.</p>

<h5>CALAS</h5>

<p>The old negro women of the old French quarters in New
Orleans used to make a delicious rice cake, which they carried
in bowls on their heads. The bowls were covered with an
immaculately clean cloth and the cakes were called bella cala&mdash;tout
chaud of New Orleans.</p>


<h5>HOW TO MAKE THIS DELICIOUS RICE CAKE</h5>

<center>(Use Level Measurements)</center>

<p>Wash one-half cup of rice and cook until tender in two
and one-half cups of boiling water. Now cool and mash the rice
well. Now dissolve one-half yeast cake in one-half cup of water
80 degrees Fahrenheit and pour into a bowl, and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of sugar,</p>
<p>One-half cup of sifted flour,</p>
<p>The mashed rice.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat well and then let rise for three-quarters of an hour in a
warm room. Now place in the pan one and one-half cups of
vegetable oil. Heat until hot enough to brown a crust of
bread while you count forty. Drop the rice mixture in by the
spoonful and fry until golden brown. Lift to a soft paper to
drain. Dish on a hot platter; cover with warm napkin. Dust
with pulverized sugar and nutmeg.</p>


<h5>APPLE AND RICE CUSTARD</h5>

<p>Wash six tablespoons or two ounces of rice in several waters
and then place in a saucepan and add two cupsful of boiling
water. Cook until the water is absorbed and the rice soft.
Now wash, then cut into small pieces four small apples and
then cover the apples with cold water and cook until soft. Rub
through a fine sieve and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of sugar,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of vanilla,</p>
<p>One well-beaten egg,</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>


<h5>ORANGES</h5>

<p>The first orange crop of the season usually reaches the
market about the end of October. The early Floridas are first,
and they are closely followed by the Arizona navels, and
just before Christmas comes the bulk of California and Florida oranges.</p>


<h5>ORANGE SYRUP</h5>

<p>Grate very lightly the rind from one dozen oranges and
then place three pounds of sugar and the grated rind and the

it will heat very slowly and then the sugar will melt. Stir
frequently and do not let it boil. Cover closely and then strain
into sterilized bottles. Place the bottles in a hot-water bath
and process for forty minutes. Place the corks in the bottles
and when cool dip in melted sealing wax. This recipe may
be divided. To be used for making drinks, sauces, etc.</p>

sterilized bottles and process for forty minutes in a hot-water
bath. Cork, and then finish like orange syrup.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;Soak the cork in boiling water for one hour to
soften. This will permit you to use a slightly larger cork and insure a good closing.</p>

<p>To use orange syrup: Place four tablespoons in a glass
and then fill with carbonated water.</p>

<p>To use orange juice for making orangeade, dilute with
equal parts of water and juice and chill, then serve.</p>

<h5>RHUBARB</h5>

<p>To cook rhubarb, cut it into inch pieces and remove the
stringy peel. Cook in a glass or earthen casserole dish in the
oven until it is soft, adding just enough sugar to sweeten. This
will give you a splendid product.</p>

<p>Do not use the leaves of the rhubarb. And do not cook
rhubarb in tin; the mineral salt or acid content of the fruit
reacts upon the metal and sets up an active poison.</p>


<h5>TO COOK RHUBARB FOR PIES</h5>

<p>Prepare the rhubarb and then sprinkle well with flour and
add sugar, and cook slowly until tender. The flour will thicken
the mixture. Then pour into the prepared pie plate and
cover with pastry. Bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes.
Pie made in this way will be far superior to that made
where the rhubarb is cut and placed in the pie and then cooked.</p>


<h5>RHUBARB AND RAISIN CONSERVE</h5>

<h5>GINGER DELICACIES</h5>

<p>The West Indians make and serve many delicious desserts
and conserves made with ginger. Either the prepared ginger
in pots may be used or the ordinary ginger root may be obtained
from the grocery shops. Ask for stem ginger, as this kind is
less apt to be stringy and coarse.</p>

<p>To prepare: Soak the ginger in warm water over night and
then in the morning wash, using a vegetable brush. Now scrape
well and then place in fresh water enough to cover&mdash;and cook
gently on the back of the stove until tender. Or it may be
placed in the fireless cooker over night. When the root is tender, place</p>

<p>in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes and
then add the ginger. Now place where it will just keep warm and
simmer until the syrup is absorbed. Remove and stand in a
cool place for two days. Reheat and then drain on a sieve and

whipped cream and puree of pineapple by cutting and folding
until well mixed. Pour into two-quart mould and cover with
wax paper; then place on the lid, and use one pint of salt to
two and one-half pints of finely crushed ice, to set the mousse to freeze.</p>

<h5>A FEW POINTERS ABOUT VEGETABLES</h5>

<p>Do not oversalt vegetables. Never salt while cooking;
too much salt not only toughens the delicate fibres but also
neutralizes the valuable mineral content.</p>

<p>Add just sufficient boiling water to cover and then bring
to a boil. Then cook slowly until tender. Do not cover the
saucepan in which the vegetables are cooking. This condenses
the steam which contains the volatile oils and thus darkens the vegetable.</p>

<h5>SPINACH</h5>

<p>Let us first begin with the washing of the spinach. Take
your cleanser and scour out the sink and then scald it with
boiling water. Now place a clean cloth over the drain and
turn the spinach into the sink. Use plenty of lukewarm water
to wash with. This is necessary to free these crinky little leaves
from the sand and grit. Now rinse in plenty of cold water to
crisp it. Shake the spinach dry and place in a deep saucepan
and cover and then steam gently until tender. Do not add any
water. In this manner the spinach is virtually cooked in its
own juices. Now turn into a chopping bowl and chop fine and
then rub through a coarse sieve and it is ready for use. You
must prepare and cook the spinach early in the day, so that you
will have time to properly prepare it, and then, when it is
wanted, simply reheat it.</p>

from the fire and add yolk of one egg. Beat very hard and then
fold in stiffly beaten white of egg; season slightly with nutmeg, chill and serve.</p>

<p>Strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, huckleberries, cherries,
grapes, currants, apples, peaches, pears, oranges, lemon
and quinces may be used for these soups. They are delicious
when served ice cold on a hot day.</p>


<h5>MEATS</h5>

<p>Use oven for baking and boiling and then cook your meats
in the old-fashioned English way by direct contact with the
flame. This means that you must first place one quart of water
and one tablespoon of salt in the broiler pan of the gas range;
then place in the roast, steak or chops, upon the broiler; turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg 155]</span>
every few minutes. The roast must be placed farther from the
flame to prevent burning. A good rule for this is to keep roasting
meat four inches from the flame, steaks and chops two and
one-half inches and fish three inches.</p>

<p>The placing of water in the broiler pan prevents fat from
catching fire. This liquid may be allowed to cool and then the
fat may be removed and clarified and used for other purposes.
Baste roast with one pint of boiling water while cooking.</p>


<h5>ROASTING AND BAKING MEATS</h5>

<p>Roasting or grilling is done before open fire, the meat being
turned frequently, so that all sides may be cooked alike. The
meat is basted with its own fat. This method of cooking meat
is used daily in Europe, but not much used in this country.</p>

<p>When a piece of meat is large it is roasted. Meat cooked in
an oven by radiated heat is frequently called in this country
"roasting." It is well known and needs little description.
When baking meat always use a wire rack to lift the meat from
the bottom of the pan. This will insure even cooking.</p>

<p>Use the broiling oven in the gas range for roasting, placing
rack sufficiently low. Have the oven hot enough to brown the
meat quickly, then reduce the heat so that it will cook evenly;
turn the roast three times during this process.</p>

<p>Allow one-half an hour after placing meat in the oven before
counting time. This is necessary so that the meat may
reach the required temperature to start cooking.</p>

<p>To bake (oven roast) use same process, using regular oven.</p>

<p>Start counting time after meat is one-half hour in oven
and allow twelve minutes to the pound for very rare, fifteen
minutes for rare, eighteen minutes for medium and twenty for well done.</p>

<p>Baste the meat with the liquid in the pan every fifteen
minutes. Do not add seasoning to the meat while cooking. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg 156]</span>
is a well-known fact that salt will cause the juices and flavoring
of the meat to dissolve and therefore become lost. Season steaks
and chops just before serving. Season roasts five minutes before
removing from the oven. Always make the gravy after
removing the meat from the pan.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;Never dish meat on a cold platter. The contact
of a cold dish with the hot meat will injure its delicate aroma.</p>

<p>In many portions of France and England chops and steaks
are served upon platters set over a bowl of hot water or a special
fuel that can be burned in a container that holds the platter.
When serving a large steak always have a cover of metal or
another hot dish turned over the meat to prevent it chilling.</p>


<h5>CORRECT METHOD OF BOILING MEAT</h5>

<p>Place the meat in a saucepan of boiling water and then
keep the water boiling rapidly for five minutes after the meat
is added. Then place the saucepan in a position where it will
cook just below the boiling point for the required length of time.
Constant and rapid boiling will cause the albumen in the meat to
harden; therefore, no amount of cooking afterward will soften
the fibre. It will only cause the meat to fall apart without being tender.</p>

<p>It is important to keep the saucepan closely covered. This
will prevent the delicate aroma from evaporating.</p>

<p>Braising: Meat is placed in a hot saucepan and turned
quickly and frequently. It is cooked in its own juices in a
closely covered saucepan.</p>

<p>Steaming: Cooking meat by placing in steam bath or steamer.</p>

<p>Grilling: Cooking meat over a hot fire on a grill made for the purpose.</p>

<p>Broiling: A very hot fire is necessary for this mode of cooking
meat. Only the choicest, tenderest, and most delicate cuts
are suitable for cooking by this method. The strong heat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg 157]</span>
instantly coagulates the albumen by searing it, thus retaining all
its juices and flavor. That this method may be successful it is
very necessary that the meat be turned every few minutes. This
also insures it being cooked evenly.</p>

<p>Pan Broiling: This is another method of cooking the fine
cuts of meat when it is not possible to broil them. Broiled meat
is more healthful and also less wasteful than any other form of cooked meat.</p>


<h5>TO PAN BROIL</h5>

<p>Heat an iron frying pan red hot, then place in it the meat. Turn it constantly.</p>

roasting pan, place in hot oven for thirty minutes. Now reduce
heat to moderate and roast, allowing thirty minutes to the
pound; baste with boiling water after meat is in oven one-half hour.</p>

<p>Fresh ham and shoulder may be roasted in same manner.</p>


<h5>SPANISH KIDNEY STEW</h5>

<p>Cut three pork kidneys in one-inch pieces, rejecting the
tubes and fat, and then soak in warm water and one tablespoon
of lemon juice for one hour. Drain, and then parboil and drain

<h5>MUTTON</h5>

<p>Mutton is the dressed carcass of the full-grown sheep and is
usually prime in animals from three to five years old. If any
older than this it lacks flavor and is tough.</p>

<p>The cuts of mutton and of lamb are the same, namely:
The meat is divided into fore and hind quarters and then cut into
the neck, shoulder, rack, breast, loin and leg.</p>

<p>The shoulder and leg are used for roasting and may be boned
and then filled and rolled. For choice rack, cut to the tenth
rib as for the chops. Three ribs and the neck for stewing,
meat pies, goulashes, etc. The loin for chops.</p>

<p>The French and English have methods of cutting and cooking
mutton and lamb that made these cuts delicious.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>

<p>Mutton and lamb chops may be used for frying purposes.
It can be blended with equal amounts of ham, bacon, pork or
beef fat. Save every bit of fat and use it for making soap.
This fat makes a fine soft soap for scouring and cleaning.</p>

<h5>SHELL FISH</h5>

<p>Shellfish includes crabs, both hard and soft shell, lobsters,
shrimp, terrapin, green turtle, snapper, etc.</p>

<p>All shellfish must be actively alive before cooking. This
is the essential point and will prevent ptomaine poisoning. Never
cook shellfish if they are dead. Remember, they are deadly.</p>

<p>Place a boiler of water on the stove and bring to a boil.
Add one tablespoon of red pepper and one cup of vinegar. To
cook lobster, shrimp, crabs, etc., cover and cook rapidly for
twenty-five minutes for the medium size, fifteen minutes for the
small and thirty minutes for the large ones.</p>

<p>When cooked, remove from the water and place under cold
water. Let cool. Place on the ice until needed.</p>

<p>To clean crabs break off the claws and then save the two
large ones. Then remove the apron pieces of the shell, like a
plate under the eyes. Break the shell apart and remove the
spongy fingers, sandbag and eggs, if any. Wash well. You
now have white oval-shaped pieces of crab meat, that must be
picked from its cells. Split with a silver knife and use an
oyster fork to pick out the meat. This can be used for au gratin,
&#224; la King, ravigotte, deviled crabs, salads, croquettes and crab cakes.</p>

Lift to a hot platter and spread with this sauce: Place on a plate</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of butter,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of lemon juice,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of grated onion,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of finely chopped onion,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>


<h5>BAKED SHAD</h5>

<p>Select a two and one-half pound shad. Have the fish dealer
clean and prepare it for baking. Now prepare a filling as follows: Place in a bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of breadcrumbs,</p>
<p>Two onions, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of finely chopped parsley,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of pepper,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of thyme,</p>
<p>One egg,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of salad oil.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix well and then fill into the fish. Sew the opening with a
stout string and a darning needle. Pat the flour into the fish.
Place in a baking pan and bake in a hot oven for one hour.
Baste every fifteen minutes with one cup of boiling water.
Now, if you place a strip of cheesecloth under the fish you will
be able to lift it without breaking. Use the leftover portions for
shad au gratin for Monday night's dinner.</p>


<h5>PLANKED SHAD</h5>

<p>Have the fish dealer split the shad for planking. Soak the
plank in cold water for two hours and then place the fish on the
plank, and brush it with lemon juice. Place in the lowest part
of the broiler of the gas range. Begin to baste with cold water
after the fish has been in the oven for twelve minutes. Allow
thirty minutes for planking a two and one-half pound shad.</p>


<h5>LONG ISLAND DEEP SEA PIE</h5>

<p>Grease a deep baking dish and then sprinkle with fine bread
crumbs. Now place a layer of finely diced potatoes in the
bottom of the dish. Next a layer of cooked fish, cut into pieces
the size of a walnut. Next a layer of sliced onions; then a layer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg 175]</span>
of sliced tomatoes; repeat, making two layers. Season each
layer with salt, pepper and finely minced parsley. Now prepare a sauce as follows:</p>

<p>Place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cups of milk in a saucepan,</p>
<p>Six level tablespoons of flour.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir until the flour is dissolved and then bring to a boil.
Remove from the fire and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce,</p>
<p>One well-beaten egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Pour over the prepared pie. Place a crust on top, making
three or four gashes in it to permit the steam to escape. Bake in slow oven one hour.</p>


<h5>APPETIZERS</h5>

<p>The appetizer is a small morsel of food served at the beginning
of the meal, causes a free flow of digestive juice and thus
helps the digestion. During the growing season these canap&#233;s
may be scullions, served icy cold, radishes, cold and crisp and
cut into thin pieces, but still left on the stem; well-cleaned,
crisp, crinkly watercress; coleslaw, with celery; coleslaw with
green and red peppers or with scullions, or with bacon or ham
nicely browned; or just a slice of full ripe tomato, spread with
mayonnaise and dusted with grated cheese or paprika.</p>

<p>Many housewives have the impression that the preparation
of the delicious accessories of the cosmopolitan meal is expensive.
Well, I hardly need tell you that the French housewife is noted
for her thrift and that these dainty tidbits are frequently
portions of leftovers from a meal, sometimes the scrapings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>
of a saucepan or a tablespoon of meat, vegetables and gravy.</p>

<p>Have you ever had just a small piece of fish left over, entirely
too small to serve by itself? And rather than leave it on a
plate or saucer to form an accumulation you think, "Well, I
can't use it, so into the garbage it goes."</p>

<p>Now this tablespoon or two of fish would have made you a
few delicious canap&#233;s; by flaking it and then putting it through
a sieve. Place it on a platter and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of butter,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of grated onion,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of finely minced parsley.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth paste and then spread on a narrow
strip of toast. Garnish with a slice of hard-boiled egg.</p>

<p>The canap&#233;, though it bears a foreign name, is not necessarily
an expensive addition to the menu for the family, nor is
it elaborate. This delectable morsel is rather dainty, delicate
and used as an appetizer that helps to start and stimulate the
digestive juices and thus cause them to flow freely for the digestion of the food.</p>

<p>Canap&#233;s are usually served cold, on a plate covered with a
doily; the canap&#233; is placed on this. They need not all be alike;
the bread may be cut with various sandwich cutters or it may
be cut into finger widths and then toasted lightly and spread
with the prepared paste.</p>

<p>Meat, chicken, cheese, nuts, olives, etc., may be used in place
of the fish. If you have just a spoonful or so of peas, beans,
spinach, cauliflower or asparagus you may use it in place of the
fish, thus making a vegetable canap&#233;. Try two canned pimentos
in place of either meat or fish.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg 177]</span>


<h5>EGG CUTLETS</h5>

<p>Make a cream sauce, using six level teaspoons of flour to

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of finely chopped parsley,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of finely grated onion,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One-quarter cup of fine bread crumbs.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and then pour on well-greased platter. Cool for four
hours. To mould, form into shape and then dip in flour, then
in beaten egg and then in fine bread crumbs. Fry until golden
brown in hot fat or vegetable oil. Serve with tomato sauce.</p>


<h5>BAKED EGGS IN CORN CASES</h5>

<p>Make ten corn muffins, from the following mixture:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-quarter cups of milk,</p>
<p>One egg,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of syrup,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of shortening.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard to mix and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-quarter cups of sifted flour,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of cornmeal,</p>
<p>Five teaspoons of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat thoroughly to mix and then pour into well-greased
muffin pans and bake for thirty-five minutes in a hot oven. Now
cut from the top one slice from each of the four muffins and use
a spoon to scoop out the centres. Break an egg and then fill
to the top with cheese sauce. Sprinkle with bread crumbs and
set in a baking pan and bake for twenty minutes in a moderate
oven. Serve with either cream or tomato sauce.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg 178]</span>


<h5>SPANISH OMELET</h5>

<p>Beat whites of three eggs until stiff, then carefully cut and
fold in yolks of three eggs. Then when well blended, pour in
hot frying pan containing three tablespoons of shortening;
cook slowly, shaking frequently until mixture is dry on top.
Now spread with a filling prepared as follows:</p>

<p>Place in a bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons grated onion,</p>
<p>One-half cup of well-drained tomatoes,</p>
<p>Four olives, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of paprika.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook this mixture in two tablespoons of shortening until hot,
spread on omelet, fold and roll, turn on hot dish, sprinkle with
paprika and garnish with finely chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Two tablespoons of finely chopped parsley.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now fill into five pimentos. Place in a baking pan and bake
for fifteen minutes. Remove and then place on a hot platter,
flattening well; then place one poached egg on each pepper.
Cover with cheese sauce and garnish with parsley.</p>


<h5>CODDLED EGGS</h5>

<p>Place a teaspoon of butter in an egg glass or custard cup.
Break in two eggs, then add one teaspoon of butter and place in
a cup of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook for three minutes.
Lift cups on saucers, dust the eggs lightly with paprika, and
serve. Use two eggs for each service.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg 179]</span>

<p>How to utilize and serve leftover food so there will be no
actual waste has perplexed many young housewives, and as one
woman writes me: "I try to keep down the leftovers, but every
once in so often they just rise up and conquer me."</p>

<p>Every housewife knows that, no matter how carefully she
plans there is sure to be a small quantity of leftover meat,
gravy or vegetables. And just what to do with them is almost
a daily problem. Two essentials are necessary to successfully
utilize leftovers: First, good seasoning; second, attractive appearance.</p>

<p>The French excel in serving leftovers because they so thoroughly
understand the art of flavoring and seasoning. The
French housewife knows very well that she may only have a
<i>pot au feu</i> to serve to the family, but the family knows that the
delicate, attractive manner in which the food is put on the table
would appeal to the epicure, though the table is but a plain
ash top, scoured to the whiteness of the snows.</p>


<h5>HOW TO PREPARE A FAGGOT OF SOUP HERBS</h5>

<p>Place in separate piles:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One branch of parsley,</p>
<p>One-quarter leek,</p>
<p>Two branches of thyme,</p>
<p>One-half carrot, cut lengthwise,</p>
<p>One bay leaf.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Tie in bunches and then dry thoroughly and place in a fruit jar until needed.</p>


<h5>FRENCH SEASONINGS</h5>

<p>Each housewife prepares her own seasonings from her garden.
You know, she grows them in the garden, and as the
leaves become abundant she picks them each day, dries them
thoroughly, and then places them in separate containers. She
prepares the faggots of soup herbs and has them ready for instant use.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg 180]</span>


<h5>GARLIC</h5>

<p>Few American persons know of the garlic but as a rank,
pungent flavor. To the foreigner garlic is as sweet tasting as
the onion and its flavor delightful in food. Just that dash that
it needs to give it zest. Separate a clump of garlic into cloves
and then peel and place in a fruit jar. Now bring one pint of
white wine vinegar to the scalding point and then pour it over
the garlic. Place on the cover and set in a warm place for
two days. Use this vinegar for seasoning gravies and use the
garlic, cut into tiny bits the size of a pinhead, for flavoring.</p>

<p>For serving, use individual ramekin casseroles, baking shells,
and thus make for efficient and quick handling of the food, in
which the food itself is presented in a most attractive way. A
good blend of seasoning is most important, so I am going to
give you a French housewife's secret. Mince four medium-sized
onions very fine, then place in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Six tablespoons of salt,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of paprika,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of thyme,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of sweet marjoram,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of sage,</p>
<p>Pinch of cloves,</p>
<p>Pinch of allspice.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Rub together until thoroughly mixed and then put in a
warm dry place for twenty-four hours. Put through a fine
sieve. Place in a bottle and use one teaspoon of this mixture in place of salt.</p>

<p>The average housewife seldom thinks of using such herbs
as sweet basil, sorrel, tarragon, leek and chervil, yet they give
a delicious flavoring not only to soups, stews, ragouts and
goulashes, but to made dishes. They can be grown in the
kitchen garden. A good sauce is important, and not only
increases the portion, but also gives it an attractive appearance.</p>

<p>Leftover meats and vegetables may be turned into palatable
food with just a little time and energy. The basis of all croquettes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg 181]</span>
should be a good thick moulding sauce that will give
a product that is creamy and delicious to taste.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that croquettes and cutlets are usually
fried in hot fat, it is not necessary to add either shortening or
butter to the cream sauce.</p>

<p>The true secret to good croquettes or cutlets is to have
the mixture rich and creamy. Mould into croquettes and then
dip in flour and then in the egg mixture and finally roll in fine
crumbs. Now fry until golden brown in hot fat.</p>

<p>How to make the foundation:</p>

<p>Place in a saucepan:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of milk,</p>
<p>Seven level tablespoons of flour,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to dissolve the flour and then bring to a boil. Cook
slowly for five minutes and then add the flavoring and seasoning.
Set aside to cool and then mould. Form into croquettes, roll in
flour, dip in beaten egg and then roll in fine bread crumbs and
fry until golden brown in hot fat.</p>


<h5>NUT AND PEPPER CROQUETTES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two green peppers,</p>
<p>Two medium-sized onions,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mince very fine and then parboil and drain. Turn on a
cloth and pat dry. Place in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of cream sauce, made as given in the method,</p>
<p>One-half cup of finely chopped nuts,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of grated cheese.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly and then pour on a large platter and allow
to cool, then finish as directed for cheese croquettes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg 182]</span>


<h5>LIMA BEAN CROQUETTES</h5>

<p>Wash and soak overnight three-quarters cup of baby lima
beans. In the morning parboil until tender and then drain until very dry. Now put</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One green pepper,</p>
<p>Two medium-sized onions,</p>
<p>Four pieces of bacon,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>through a food chopper. Place in a pan and cook until the
onions and peppers are soft. Drain free from fat and then put
the beans through the food chopper and add:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>The prepared peppers and onions and bacon,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly and then mould into croquettes and dip in
flour, then in beaten egg, and roll in fine bread crumbs. Fry
until golden brown in hot fat.</p>

<p>Leftover meat may be minced fine and seasoned as follows:</p>

<p>Put a sufficient amount of cold cooked meat or fish through
the food chopper to measure three-quarters cup and</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One large onion,</p>
<p>Four branches of parsley,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place the mixture in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One cup of cream sauce,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>made as directed in the method, then the finely chopped meat
and one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. Mix thoroughly
and then set aside to mould. Form into croquettes and roll in
flour, dip in beaten egg and then roll in fine bread crumbs. Fry in hot fat.</p>

<p>Cold beef, lamb, chicken, veal, ham or crab meat or fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg 183]</span>
may be used for this delectable method of serving an entr&#233;e.
Nuts, eggs, cheese, both cottage or pot, and store cheese, may
be used. Dried peas, lima beans, navy and soy beans as well
as cow peas and lentils will afford a splendid variety to the
thrifty housewife who must provide cheap protein dishes.</p>

<p>The difference between a croquette and a cutlet is just in the
shape. Croquettes are shaped either in the cylindrical or conical
forms and cutlets in flat, either round, triangle or chop shape.</p>

<p>To prepare the egg for dipping add four tablespoons of
evaporated milk and beat hard to thoroughly blend. Place
croquette or cutlet on wire spoon and use tablespoon to pour
the beaten egg over the croquette.</p>

<p>To prepare the crumbs dry all pieces of stale bread thoroughly.
No bit is too small, a crust or even the crumbs left
from cutting the bread. Put the well-dried bread through the
food chopper and then sift through the colander; either put the
coarse crumbs through the food chopper the second time or
keep them for au gratin dishes.</p>

<p>Always serve either cream or tomato sauce with croquettes
and cutlets and garnish them with parsley or cress.</p>

<h4>SAUCES</h4>


<p>A formula is necessary if the housewife is to have her sauces uniform, so that</p>

<p>One level tablespoon of flour and one cup of milk make a thin sauce, as for soups.</p>

<p>Two level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk make a thin sauce.</p>

<p>Three level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk make a medium sauce.</p>

<p>Four tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk make a thick sauce.</p>

<p>Five level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk make a
sauce for cutlets, croquettes, etc.</p>

<p>Use a saucepan that is scoured bright, add the flour to the
cold milk and then stir to dissolve, using fork or wire whip to
facilitate the process. Never use a spoon for this purpose, as it
is impossible to thoroughly dissolve the lumps. Place on the
fire and bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Cook for five minutes
after the boiling point is reached and then remove from
the fire and add seasoning. It is then ready to use. If you
desire a butter flavor, add one tablespoonful of butter with the
seasoning and stir until melted.</p>

<p>Part milk and water, stock, chicken broth, oyster or clam
juice may be used in place of all milk with very good results.
When making soups or sauces for meat and vegetable dishes
the liquid from the canned vegetables, or the water in which
the fresh vegetables were cooked, may be combined with an equal portion of milk.</p>

<p>Many splendid varieties of sauce can be made from the plain
cream sauce. For parsley sauce add four tablespoonfuls of
finely chopped parsley to one cup of cream sauce.</p>

<p>In no other part of cookery does the skill of the cook show
to advantage as in the way in which the various sauces are
prepared and served. To make a perfect sauce is an art in
cooking. Many plain foods, as well as the use of leftovers,
may, by the addition of a good sauce, be turned into palatable and attractive dishes.</p>

<p>Three or four cupfuls of cream sauce may be made at one
time and then poured into a bowl and covered with a damp
napkin, and placed in the icebox until needed. The sauce will
keep in a cool place for three or four days and will relieve the
necessity of making a sauce every day.</p>

<p>To use, measure three-quarters of a cupful of sauce and
add one-quarter cupful of hot water. Place in a double boiler
to heat, stirring frequently to blend. It is then ready to use.
Always use a double boiler in the preparation of sauces made
from this cream sauce. This will prevent scorching.</p>

<h5>CHICKEN MOUSSE</h5>

<p>Put sufficient boiled cold chicken through a food chopper

  </div>  </div>

<h4>POULTRY</h4>


<p>To roast young chickens and guineas: singe, draw and prepare
the fowl; now rub the entire bird well with plenty of shortening.
Dust very lightly with flour, place in pan in hot oven
for fifteen minutes; now turn the fowl breast down in the pan
and reduce the heat of the oven to moderate. Baste every
ten minutes with following mixture:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One pint boiling water,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>When fowl is tender turn on back to allow breast to brown,
basting every five minutes. Placing the breast of the chicken
down in the pan throws the bony structure of the carcass to
the intense heat of the oven. The constant basting causes the
moisture to permeate the dry white meat, making it juicy and tender.</p>

<p>If you desire, lay a few strips of bacon over the breast
when browning it, just before you remove it from oven. It will improve the flavor.</p>

forming a roll a little larger than a sausage. Tie securely in
corn husk and place in a steamer or a double boiler and cook
for one and one-quarter hours. Other meat may be used to
replace the chicken and water may be used in place of the
chicken stock to make the mush.</p>

<h4>FATS</h4>


<p>Fat is a heat-or fuel-producing food which is very valuable
in cold weather for supplying the body with heat and energy.
Often foods that are cooked in fat are termed indigestible; this
means that the food is not utilized in the body and, owing to
some digestive disturbances, it becomes part of the waste.
Recent experiments tend to show that animal fats are assimilated
fairly well; undoubtedly it is the misuse of fat that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
used for frying purposes that has given many fried foods their
bad reputation. Every normal person requires a certain amount of fat.</p>

<p>Make it a rule when serving fried food to have an acid food,
either a vegetable or a garnish, accompany the dish.</p>

<p>Here are just a few things to keep in mind when planning
to serve fried foods: Use very small quantities of foods that are
cooked in fat for people occupying sedentary positions, while
those who are employed in active or laborious work may eat a
larger proportion. Persons who are working at hard manual
labor, out of doors, will be able to assimilate daily portions of
fried food without any physical disturbances.</p>

<p>For digestion's sake, learn to serve:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Juice of lemon with fried fish,</p>
<p>Apple sauce with pork or goose,</p>
<p>Cranberry or currant jelly with poultry, lamb or mutton,</p>
<p>Horseradish with beef.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>It is a curious thing that nature demands these combinations
to equalize the fatty content of the meal. Save and clarify the
various fats and utilize each particular kind, so that there need
be no waste. Chop all bits of suet fine and place in a double
boiler and then render. Chicken and pork fat may be rendered in this way.</p>

<p>An excellent shortening that may be used to replace butter
in cooking and baking may be made from chicken fat, of which
there is usually three or more ounces in one fat bird. Remove
the fat from the bird and place in cold salt water for one hour
and then drain and cut into small pieces. Render in a double
boiler. Pour into a jar and allow to harden. Now, when using
this fat, use one-third less than the amount called for in the
recipe. To make pastry, allow four tablespoonfuls of this
chicken fat to each cup of flour. Chicken fat may be used to
replace butter for seasoning vegetables and mashed potatoes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
This is a pure fat free from moisture and seasoning and will go farther than butter.</p>

<p>Generally, in speaking of the term "drippings," it meant
to include fats that cook out from the roast beef, pot roast,
soups and corned beef. This fat is clarified and then used for
saut&#233;ing. It cannot be used with good results for making pastry and cakes.</p>

<p>To clarify fat: Put the fat in a saucepan and add one cupful
of cold water to every pound of fat. Add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-fourth teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and then simmer slowly for ten minutes.
Pour through a strainer lined with cheesecloth and allow to
harden, then cut into pieces. Reheat and pour into jars. Bacon,
sausage and ham fats may be blended with beef drippings for frying purposes.</p>

<p>Mutton or lamb fat must be clarified and then blended with
ham and bacon or sausage fat. Fat from bacon, ham and
sausages may be used for flavoring vegetables in place of butter,
for cooking omelets, potato cakes, mush and scrapple. It is a
splendid seasoning to use for macaroni, baked beans with tomato
sauce, dried beans and peas in soups and when cooking dried
lima beans. There is really no need to allow a spoonful of
these fats to be wasted. Fats that are not available for table
use should be collected and made into soap.</p>

<p>Do not be falsely economical in trying to do deep frying
with these fats. They not only will not hold the temperature
for successful frying without scorching, but they frequently
soak into the food and make it unfit to eat.</p>

<p>The late war has brought many good vegetable oils upon
the market that are ideal for cooking purposes and are preferable
to the animal fats for all cooking. They not only
hold a high temperature without burning, but also they may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
used repeatedly if they are strained each time after using.
Food cooked in vegetable oil does not absorb the fat and it is
more digestible and really more economical.</p>




<h4>FRYING</h4>


<p>There are two methods of frying:</p>

<p><i>First</i>.&mdash;Saut&#233;ing&mdash;cooking food in the pan with just sufficient
fat to prevent scorching. This method is commonly used,
but has nothing to really recommend it, as the food absorbs
quantities of grease. This makes it difficult to digest.</p>

<p><i>Second</i>.&mdash;Deep-fat frying&mdash;it is usual to dip the food to be
fried in a mixture to coat it and then to roll it in fine bread
crumbs and then cook in sufficient fat to cover. This forms an
air-tight cover that prevents the grease from soaking through.
A few essential utensils are necessary to produce successful results;
first, a heavy kettle that will not tilt, and second, a
frying basket, so that the food may be removed quickly when cooked.</p>

<p>The correct temperature for deep-fat frying is 350 degrees
Fahrenheit, for raw foods, such as crullers, fish, fritters, potatoes,
etc. For cooked dishes and oysters, cheeseballs, etc., 370 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Do not attempt to cook large quantities at one time. This
will cause a sudden drop in the temperature of the fat, allowing
it to permeate the food which is cooking and thus give a greasy product.</p>

<p>Now for a word of protection. Do not use too large a
kettle. Keep a bucket of sand handy in the kitchen, and if for
any reason the fat catches fire, throw sand on it; do not attempt
to remove it from the stove; serious burns are apt to result. Just
turn out the light and throw sand on the fire. Keep the fact in
mind that water spreads the flames; if no sand is at hand, use salt or flour.</p>

<h5>ARTICHOKES</h5>

<p>The artichoke is a plant closely resembling the thistle, and
it is extensively cultivated for its flowering head. The head is
gathered just before the flower expands. The eatable portion
is the fleshy part of the calyx, the bottom or basin of the blossom
and the true base of the leaves of the flower.</p>

<p>The flesh of the artichokes correspond closely to that which
the old world folks call the cheese of the thistle. On the Continent,
in Europe, the artichoke is frequently served raw, as a
salad, with either French or Parisian dressing. Under ordinary
circumstances the fruit as prepared for market will keep several
weeks. The canned artichoke, which was imported quite extensively
before the war, consisted of the fronds and bottoms.
It came in large quantities from both France and Italy.</p>

<p>The artichoke buds are used exclusively for garnishing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span>


<h5>THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE</h5>

<p>This kind of artichoke is a tuber of the species of the sunflower;
it resembles somewhat the Irish potato. It has a sweetish
flavor and contains a large amount of natural water. This
species of artichoke is more valuable than the common artichoke.</p>

<p>The two principal types of the Jerusalem artichokes are</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>First: Long with reddish skin,</p>
<p>Second: Round, knobby and white in color.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>On the Continent they are frequently eaten raw, with just
a plain seasoning of salt, pepper and vinegar; in fact, much
as we eat the American radish. They are frequently made into soup.</p>

<p>The word Jerusalem is a queer cross of dialect from the
Italian word <i>girasole</i>, meaning sunflower.</p>


<h5>TO COOK</h5>

<p>Soak the fruit in a bowl of cold water for two hours; then
shake about in the water freely to remove all traces of sand.
Plunge into boiling water and cook until tender; then drain.
Serve in choice of following methods:</p>


<h5>ARTICHOKE HOLLANDAISE SAUCE</h5>

Fry until golden brown in hot fat and serve as a garnish with
omelets, fish, cold meat, etc.</p>


<h5>BAKED ONIONS</h5>

<p>Large or Spanish onions are best for this dish. Peel the
onions and then boil until tender, and then take care that the
onion does not become soft. Lift and then cool, and carefully
remove the centres. Now prepare the following as a filling for
four large or eight medium-sized onions.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<h5>FISH</h5>

<p>Fish are divided into two classes&mdash;those having backbones,
which are called vertebrates; and those which have no backbones,
and are called shellfish.</p>

<p>The vertebrates are classified as fresh and salt-water fish,
and they contain both white and dark meat. Fish is similar
to meat in composition and structure and is classed among
the protein or body-building foods; it may replace meat or its
equivalent on the menu.</p>

<p>The muscle consists of a bundle of fibers, bound together
by a connective tissue; it is so tender that it requires much less
time to cook than meat. Fish, as a rule, contains less fat than
meat, and while there is considerable refuse, it will be found
to be about equal to the bone in meat.</p>

<p>The methods of cooking fish are: Broiling, boiling, baking,
deep fat frying and saut&#233;ing.</p>


<h5>TO BOIL FISH</h5>

<p>Cleanse and prepare the fish. Tie in a piece of cheese-cloth
and then plunge into a kettle of boiling court bouillon. Cook,
allowing twenty minutes to the pound. Lift, drain well and then
turn on a hot platter, laying a napkin under the fish to absorb
the moisture. Serve with either cream, Hollandaise, egg or tomato
sauce and garnish with slices of hard-boiled egg, beet and
carrots cut in dice or capers, diced beets, slices of lemon.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg 230]</span>


<h5>BAKED FISH</h5>

<p>Cleanse and prepare the fish, leaving the head and tail on
the body, but remove the eyes and fins. Now prepare a filling as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of bread crumbs,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of shortening,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One small onion grated,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and then fill into the fish. Fasten the opening with a
string or with toothpicks. Place in a baking dish and rub with
plenty of shortening. Dust with flour and place in a hot oven
to bake. Baste every fifteen minutes with boiling water. Allow
eighteen minutes to the pound and twenty minutes for the fish
to heat thoroughly and start baking.</p>

<h4>SOUP</h4>


<p>Soup, unless it is a thick cream or puree, contains little food
value. Rather, it is stimulating to the stomach and causes a
free flow of the digestive juices. Thus the food taken in after
the soup has stimulated the stomach is quickly absorbed and
thus gives the body immediate nourishment without distressing the digestion.</p>

<p>The French lay great stress upon two essentials in making
soup successfully. First, it must not go below the boiling point,
just a gentle bubbling, and, second, after once started, no water
should be added. In making soup always use cold water to start
with. Do not use salt or any seasoning, and heat slowly, keeping
the pot closely covered.</p>

<p>Protein, which is the chief constituent of meat, is drawn into
the liquid, making it very nutritious. Rapid boiling destroys
the fine aroma and volatile oils, which escape in the steam.</p>

<p>Soups are divided into three classes: First, stock; second,
cream; third, fruit soups.</p>

<p>Soups made from meat and bone are called stock; those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg 238]</span>
without stock are called cream, such as cream vegetable, clam
and oyster soups, and, lastly, those made from meat and bones,
cooked by long and slow boiling, which dissolves the soluble
elements of the meat and bones into the water and makes a very rich soup.</p>


<h5>THE STOCK POT</h5>

<p>This should be a deep pot or kettle with a tight-fitting lid.
This is important, so that none of the steam may be lost by
evaporation. The steam contains the aroma or fine volatile
oil and essentials which pass into the air. In a fairly large
family little meat need be purchased for the stock pot if the
housewife insists that all portions of bone and trimming be sent
with the purchased meat. The French women look with horror
on the American women leaving all the scrap and trimming to the butcher.</p>


<h5>TO MAKE THE STOCK</h5>

<p>A soup bone from the shin, beef, which is full of nutriment,
will have nearly one-half pound of meat on it. Take one pound
of the scrag end of the neck of veal and four quarts of water.
Wash the bones and add the cold water and bring slowly to a
boil. Skim and then cover closely and cook for four hours.
By this time the meat will have fallen from the bones. Strain
and set aside to cool. Let stand overnight. This is best.</p>

<p>Then remove all fat from the top. This stock is the basis
of all soups, sauces and gravies. It is rich in mineral matter
and gelatine. The meat can be taken from the bones and run
through the food chopper and used for meat loaf, croquettes
and meat biscuits or sausage, and it will make mighty tasty hash
when combined with potatoes and onions for breakfast.</p>

<p>You now have a delicious and nutritious broth, without seasoning
of any kind, which will keep in cold weather four or five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg 239]</span>
days. In warm weather it must be returned every second day
to the pot, brought to a boil and skimmed and then left to cool
and finally put in the ice box. Small portions of meat, ham, any
trimming and bones that have accumulated may be added.
Chicken feet, scalded in boiling water to loosen the outer skin,
which must be peeled off, together with the giblets of fowl, may
be added to the stock pot. Seasoning and the addition of vegetables
cause it to sour. Many varieties of soup are possible
with the use of this stock.</p>


<h5>OYSTER GUMBO</h5>

<p>Mince two medium-sized onions very fine and then place in a saucepan and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One pint of hot water,</p>
<p>One pint of oyster liquid,</p>
<p>One pint of milk.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and cook for five minutes. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of flour dissolved in</p>
<p>One-half cup of milk.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir well until it reaches the boiling point, and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Twenty-five oysters,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of file (gumbo powder),</p>
<p>One ounce of butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook for five minutes and then pour the gumbo into a tureen
and add three tablespoons of finely chopped parsley. File, or
gumbo powder, is made by the Choxtaw Indians from young
sassafras leaves. The Indians gather the leaves, spread them
upon the bark to dry and then grind them into a fine powder,
put it through a fine sieve and then pack it into pouches or
jars. It is sold in the French markets in New Orleans and in
all high-class importing groceries. The Indians use the sassafras
both medicinally and in cookery, and the Creoles quickly
discovered this and appreciated it when making their famous gumbo or file.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg 240]</span>


<h5>VEGETABLE SOUP</h5>

<p>One pint of stock, one cup of tomato pulp, made by scalding
the peeling of tomatoes, or the canned tomatoes, may be used, and</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of diced potatoes,</p>
<p>One-half cup of mixed vegetables; cabbage, turnips and peas, may be added</p>
<p>One-half carrot cut in dice,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of parsley,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of flour,</p>
<p>Salt and pepper to taste,</p>
<p>Portion of bunch of potherbs.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Take a bunch of potherbs, divide into small bunches and tie
each with a string and then use one of these in the vegetable
soup. Put the remainder of the herbs in a fruit jar until needed again.</p>

<p>Put the herbs in the stock, add the tomatoes and let simmer.
Cook the vegetables in one pint of water until tender and then
add water and all to the stock and add the seasoning and flour,
mixed with a little cold water, and cook for five minutes.</p>


<h5>TO MAKE NOODLES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One egg,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of water,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat together until well mixed and then add sufficient flour
to make a stiff dough. Knead until elastic&mdash;about two minutes&mdash;and
then roll out on a pastry board until as thin as paper,
dusting the board lightly with flour to prevent sticking. Permit
it to stand for fifteen minutes to dry and then cut into strings,
thick and thin. Do this by rolling up loosely, like a jelly roll,
and then cut. Lay on a dish to dry. When thoroughly dry
they may be kept in a fruit jar. Part of the paste may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg 241]</span>
stamped with small vegetable cutters and cooked in the soup same as the noodles.</p>

<p>Vegetables cut in fancy shapes, macaroni cut in small rings,
hard-boiled eggs in slices, cheese balls, slices of lemon, also rice
and barley, may be added to the soup.</p>

<p>To make brown coloring: One-half cup of sugar cooked
ten minutes in an iron pan until burned black; then add one-half
cupful of water. Let come to a boil and then strain and bottle for use.</p>

<p>The principal points to keep in mind when making soup are:</p>

<p>First, draw out all of the juice and soluble flavors into the water.</p>

<p>Second, retain that which we have drawn out by using a
pot with a tight-fitting lid.</p>

<p>Third, use cold water with which to extract meat juices and flavors.</p>

<p>Fourth, long, slow cooking.</p>

<p>Fifth, flavoring and vegetables added after making stock
prevent its souring quickly.</p>

<p>Sixth, do not use stock pot for other than it is intended.
Care and accurate judgment and measuring will give successful results.</p>

<p>If most of the work is done in the morning while attending
to the kitchen duties, the stock-making will take little of your
time. Delicious gravies may be made by using stock instead of water.</p>


<h5>CLEAR SOUP</h5>

<p>Use two tablespoons of fat and fry one onion until brown.
Add two tablespoons of flour and brown well and then pour in
one pint of stock and cook for five minutes, and then add seasoning,
salt and pepper to taste. Strain into a soup tureen and
sprinkle with one tablespoon of finely chopped parsley. Serve
with bread cut in finger lengths and toasted.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg 242]</span>


<h5>CELERY PUREE</h5>

<p>Use one pint of diced celery and cook in one cup of cold
water until tender and then put through a sieve and add one cup of stock,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of milk,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of flour mixed with a little milk,</p>
<p>Seasoning,</p>
<p>Salt and pepper,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of chopped parsley and serve.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>To the clear soup may be added macaroni, noodles or any
vegetables. This is a good way to use left-over portions of
vegetables that are too small to serve alone.</p>


<h5>FISH SOUP</h5>

<p>Use six slices of cod, hake or flounder. Mince four onions
very fine and then place the onions in a saucepan with</p>

<h5>FISH SOUPS</h5>

<p>The bouillabaisse of France and New Orleans is most delectable
and may well be served upon our tables frequently. The
French and our Southern cooking, especially the creoles, excel
in the preparation of delicious cream soups and purees. They
are made entirely from vegetables. These good folk have preserved
an old-world custom; namely, the daily plate of soup.
The creoles have introduced a new variety of their own called gumbo.</p>

<p>Vegetables and milk are the basis for these soups. The vegetables
are cooked in water and then rubbed through a sieve.
Equal parts of milk are added and then thickened slightly and
seasoned. When it is desired to give additional food value, eggs may be added.</p>


<h5>OYSTER BROTH</h5>

<p>Drain twenty-four oysters, saving the liquid. Wash and
carefully look over the oysters to free from bits of shell. Chop
fine and place in saucepan and measure the oyster liquid, adding
sufficient water to make two cups. Simmer slowly for fifteen
minutes. Let boil up once. Strain, season to taste with salt,
pepper and then the broth is ready to serve. Equally good hot or cold.</p>


<h5>PUREE OF OYSTER</h5>

<p>Prepare two cups of thin cream sauce and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Twenty-five oysters, chopped fine,</p>
<p>One and one-half cups of oyster liquid,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of grated onion.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Simmer slowly for twenty minutes and then bring to a scalding
point. Strain, season to taste with salt and pepper, adding
two tablespoons of finely minced parsley.</p>

<p>Clams may be used to replace the oysters.</p>

<h5>TO PREPARE A STEW</h5>

<p>Wash and look over the twenty-five stewing oysters carefully

heat until the edges begin to curl. Then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of scalding milk,</p>

<h5>CELERY SOUP</h5>

<p>Wash and thoroughly cleanse the celery and then chop
fine. Place one pint of finely chopped celery in a saucepan and
add three cups of cold water. Bring to a boil and cook until

<h5>CREAM SOUPS</h5>

<p>Cream soups are a combination of vegetables, puree and
milk. Almost all of the green vegetables will make delicious
soups. Clean the vegetables well and then cut into small pieces.
Place in a saucepan and cover with cold water and bring to a
boil. Cook slowly until tender and then mash well; then rub
through a fine sieve. Use this vegetable stock with equal parts
of milk to make the soup.</p>

<p>Carrots, peas, tomatoes, turnips, corn, beans, celery, lettuce,
potatoes, beets, cucumbers, asparagus, all these afford a splendid variety.</p>

<p>Allow one level tablespoon of flour for thickening and dissolve
the flour in cold water before adding. Bring quickly to a
boil and then season. Add two tablespoons of butter for flavoring and then serve.</p>

<p>French, Swiss and Italians serve grated cheese and paprika with all cream soups.</p>


<h5>CREAM OF ONION</h5>

<p>Place two cups of thinly sliced onions in a saucepan and
add one cup of cold water. Cook until soft and then rub
through a fine sieve. Measure and return to the saucepan,
and add one cup of milk for every cup of onion puree and two
level tablespoons of flour to every cup of milk. Stir to dissolve
the flour, then bring to a boil and cook slowly for five minutes.
Season, using salt and white pepper. Serve, then add one tablespoon
of butter to every quart of cream soup. Croutons or
toasted strips of bread make a delicious accompaniment to cream soups.</p>

<p>How to prepare croutons: Cut slices of bread into one-inch
blocks and place in a baking sheet and bake until golden brown.
Place in a tin box or jar and seal. When ready to use just
reheat to crisp and then serve. Stale bread may be used for this purpose.</p>

<h5>DRIED FRUIT</h5>

<p>Oranges and grapefruit are high-priced and the dried fruits
may be substituted to advantage. If these fruits are nicely
prepared, the family will hardly be able to distinguish between
them and the fresh fruit.</p>

<p>Frequently the dried fruits are so prepared that they are
anything but inviting. Much will depend upon the selection of
these fruits. Purchase only the best grade. This fruit should
be bright and waxy and not too dry. Soak for fifteen minutes
in warm water; this loosens the dirt before washing. Now wash
in plenty of water. Cover with water and allow to stand until
the fruit has plumped out; each piece of fruit will only absorb
just the amount of moisture as it originally contained.</p>

<p>This will require from six to twelve hours, depending entirely
upon the dryness of the fruit. Be sure that the water covers
the fruit at least one inch. Now, when the fruit is ready, add
sugar to sweeten and place in the stove to cook. The slower
this fruit is cooked the better. Remember that hard, rapid cooking
not only spoils dried fruits, but fresh fruit as well.</p>

<p>When cooked tender, drain the liquid from the fruit and
measure. Allow one-half cup of sugar to every three cups of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>[pg 252]</span>
juice. Place this juice and the sugar in a separate saucepan
and boil until thick; then pour over the fruit.</p>

<p>Dried fruits prepared this way will be found to be delicious.
Apricots will require very little cooking, so drain them free
from the liquid in which they are soaked and add the sugar.
Boil the syrup until thick and then pour over the apricots and
cook gently for ten minutes.</p>

<p>Remove the skins from peaches, after soaking them, and before
cooking add a little piece of thin orange peel for flavor.</p>

<p>To prepare dried pears soak them for twelve hours and then
place in a casserole dish and add to one-half pound of fruit</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of brown sugar.</p>
<p>Juice of one lemon,</p>
<p>One cup of raisins.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cover the casserole dish and bake slowly.</p>


<h5>STEWED PEARS</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three-quarters cup of syrup,</p>
<p>One-half cup of water,</p>
<p>Six cloves,</p>
<p>Piece of cinnamon and piece of lemon peel,</p>

<h5>MACARONI</h5>

<p>Macaroni is to the Italian cook the starchy content of
the meal; just as the Irish and sweet potato are our common
starchy foods. The thrifty Italian and French housewifes have
found that by addition of meat, cheese and eggs for flavoring,
they can serve their families substantial and attractive foods at a minimum cost.</p>

<p>The average American consumer of pastes and macaroni has
no idea of the number of styles or forms&mdash;of which there are
over a hundred&mdash;into which this wheat product is made. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg 256]</span>
range from the lasagnes, which are the short, flat pieces one and
two inches wide, cut and frequently moulded by hand, to the
fideline, which are the long, thin threads, the finest of which are
many times smaller than vermicelli. Between these two extremes
there is a great variety, which includes the alphabet and many fancy designs.</p>


<h5>MACARONI MILIEUSE</h5>

of shin beef. Roll in flour and brown quickly in hot fat. Place

<p>Three pints of cold water,</p>
<p>Two onions cut fine,</p>
<p>One medium-sized carrot cut in dice.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and cook gently until the meat is tender. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of tomato aux fines herbes,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of paprika,</p>
<p>Six ounces of prepared macaroni.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring this mixture to a boil and then cook until the macaroni
is well heated. Pour on a large platter and garnish with finely chopped parsley.</p>


<h5>TO PREPARE MACARONI</h5>

<p>The macaroni may be broken into pieces one and one-half
inches long, or it may be cooked whole. In all recipes the macaroni
must first be prepared as follows:</p>

<p>Grease the bottom of a deep saucepan and then add two
quarts of boiling water. Let boil for two minutes and then add
the macaroni. Stir for a few minutes and then cook for fifteen
minutes. Turn into a colander and drain. Then blanch under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span>
the running cold water for three minutes. Let drain. It is now
ready to use in any number of ways. Greasing the saucepan
prevents the macaroni from sticking to the bottom, while it is cooking.</p>

<p>The Italian prepares a seasoning as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Wash two leeks,</p>
<p>Six branches of parsley,</p>
<p>Two green or red peppers,</p>
<p>Four branches of celery.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Pare</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Six onions,</p>
<p>Tiny bit of garlic.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in a chopping bowl and chop very fine. Now place in
one-half cup of vegetable cooking oil in a saucepan and add the
vegetables. Cook slowly until soft and then add one small can
of tomato paste. Blend well and then pour in a bowl or jar and
set in a cool place. This mixture will keep in the refrigerator
or in a cool place for one week in summer time and from ten
to twelve days in winter. This mixture is called tomato aux fine herbes.</p>

<p>Small portions of meat that would be insufficient to serve
alone can be utilized in making these dishes. When making
gravy, prepare enough so that a cup or more may be set aside
to use in the macaroni dishes. Bones, gristle and meat joints
left on the serving platter may all be made into stock, from
which the various gravies can be made. The Italian cook uses
a small piece of meat for flavoring, usually chopping it in small pieces.</p>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Blend well and then pour over the macaroni. Sprinkle
the top with fine bread crumbs and grated cheese and bake in a
moderate oven for twenty-five minutes.</p>


<h5>POTATOES</h5>

<p>This nutritious tuber is said to have saved the Irish people
from famine, and it is fitting that this variety of potato should
bear that name. The potato was unknown to Europe before
the venturesome expedition of the fifteenth century to the
Americas, where it was found to be used freely by the natives of both continents.</p>

<p>Frequently it has been said that the potato competes with
bread as the staff of life, because its use is almost universal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg 259]</span>
There are more than thirty-five varieties of potato and although
it is affected by soil and climate, the sandy soil necessary for its
successful growth is found in almost every country.</p>

<p>The housewife should understand its food value. The average
analysis of the white potato is as follows:</p>

<p>Sixty-two per cent. water, 2 per cent. protein, 1 per cent.
fat, 4 per cent. carbohydrates (starch and sugar), 20 per cent.
waste and 1 per cent. mineral ash.</p>

<p>The proportion of water found in the potato depends largely
upon the soil in which it is grown. The small protein content is
offset by its large carbohydrates (starch and sugar) content.</p>


<h5>POTATO CAKES</h5>

<p>Cook three large potatoes and then peel and mash fine.
Measure and place two cups of mashed potatoes in a mixing bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Four teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>One egg,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of milk.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix to a smooth dough and then roll out one-half inch thick
and cut and brush the tops with milk. Bake in a hot oven for eighteen minutes.</p>


<h5>POTATO DISHES</h5>

<p>One of the best forms of serving this tuber is to roast the potato
in the ashes. Few will realize how delicious it can be.
Wrap the potato in wax paper and then cover with coals and roast about one hour.</p>

<p>Next to this method comes the baked potato. Wash and dry
medium-sized potatoes and then rub well with shortening and
place in the oven and bake for thirty-five minutes for small
potatoes and fifty minutes to one hour for large ones. Greasing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg 260]</span>
the potato well before baking prevents a hard crust from forming
and permits the entire contents of the mealy sack to be eaten.
Boiling potatoes in their jackets causes the potato to lose
about 2 per cent. of its nutritive value, while peeling before
cooking causes a loss of 14 per cent. If necessary to peel, use
a sharp knife and removed the very thinnest portion of the skin;
scraping new potatoes is better than peeling them.</p>


<h5>O'BRIEN POTATOES</h5>

<p>Pare and then cut in thin slices five potatoes that have been
boiled in their jackets. Mince sufficient onions, fine, to measure
three-quarters of a cup. Chop fine two green peppers. Parboil
onions and peppers until tender and then drain well. Now
heat three tablespoons of shortening in a frying pan until very
hot and then add the potatoes and let brown. Fold over and
brown again. Keep turning over until the potatoes are well
browned and then add the prepared onions and peppers. Cook
slowly for five minutes and then turn on a hot platter and garnish
with finely chopped parsley.</p>


<h5>BOILED POTATOES</h5>

<p>To cook potatoes, either in jackets or pared: Cover with
boiling water, cook until tender. Season; now cover closely
with clean cloth to absorb moisture and the potato will be mealy.</p>


<h5>GRILLED POTATOES</h5>

<p>Wash and pare large old potatoes and then cut into thin
slices, cutting the full width of the potato. This means that you
are to cut a thin slice of raw potato that will cover your hand.
Place on a shallow baking dish and brush with shortening. Place
in the broiler and broil until nicely browned, then place in the
oven for five minutes.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg 261]</span>


<h5>MOUNTAIN BUTTERMILK RYE MUFFINS</h5>

<p>Place in a mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cups of buttermilk,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of baking soda,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of shortening,</p>
<p>Six tablespoons of syrup,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two and one-half cups of rye flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to thoroughly mix and then pour into well-greased
and floured muffin pans, and bake for thirty minutes in a moderate
oven. When cold the muffins that are left over may
be split and toasted and then spread with mountain sweet-spiced jam.</p>


<h5>IF NECESSARY TO KEEP MEAT THREE OR FOUR DAYS</h5>

<p>Much sickness that is described as ptomaine poisoning is usually
caused by carelessness. If for any reason meat must be
kept several days after it is purchased, it may be cared for in the following manner:</p>

<p>Place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three-quarters cup of salt in a saucepan</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>And add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three and one-half cups of water,</p>
<p>One bay leaf,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of saltpeter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and cool. Place the meat in a china bowl or
a wooden bucket and pour the brine over it. Now place a plate
on top of the meat and weigh down with an old flatiron and
heavy stone. Turn the meat every other day.</p>

<p>This meat will keep for one week. This method is suitable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg 262]</span>
for mutton, beef or pork. For lamb or chicken place in a saucepan and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half carrot,</p>
<p>One onion,</p>
<p>Sufficient boiling water to partially cover same.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook, keeping pan closely covered, for ten minutes to the
pound. Cool before placing in the ice box. If it is necessary to
keep the meat only until the next day, mince fine two onions and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four tablespoons of salt,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of pepper.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly and then rub the meat thoroughly with this
mixture. Meat may be kept in the ordinary ice box that holds
seventy-five pounds of ice for two days in the hottest weather in
the following manner: Wipe the meat with a dry cloth and
cover with a wax or parchment paper, and then hang from a
hook in the lower part of the refrigerator, directly under the
ice chamber if possible. The hooks are shaped like the letter S,
sharply pointed at both ends and they may be purchased or
made by any hardware dealer.</p>

<p>Meat allowed to lie on a platter soon loses its nutritious
qualities with the escaping of the juices.</p>


<h5>FILLET OF BEEF</h5>

<p>Have the butcher trim the fillet into shape and then lard it
with salt pork. Dust lightly with flour and then place on a
rack in the roasting pan and place in a hot oven, basting every
ten minutes. Cook, allowing the meat one-half hour to become
thoroughly heated and to start cooking; then allow twelve
minutes for every pound. This cut is the choicest of the
entire cattle and is without a single ounce of waste. It is delicious
either hot or cold.</p>

<h5>HOW TO COOK CORN BEEF</h5>

<p>Wash the beef in cold water and then place in a saucepan
and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and turn into a
colander, and let cold water run on the meat. Place a saucepan
on the stove and fill with boiling water, and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One carrot, cut in dice,</p>
<p>Two onions, with one clove stuck in each onion,</p>

<p>The meat.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and cook slowly, allowing the meat to cook
thirty minutes to start and then twenty minutes to the pound,
gross weight. Then remove the saucepan from the fire when
the meat is cooked and allow the meat to cool in the liquid, with
the lid removed. When cool, remove and place at once in the ice box. Serve cold.</p>

<p>Mutton may be corned like beef. The shoulder makes a
delicious economical cut. Have the butcher bone the meat, but
do not roll. Put in a pickle for six days. Remove and wash
and then tie securely, and cook in the same manner as for corned beef.</p>

remove from the fire, turn in colander and drain, rinse in cold
water and dry. Dust lightly with flour; put three tablespoons
of shortening in a pot; when hot toss in the kidney, browning
carefully; then add two cups of water, which must be boiling,
and cook until the kidney is tender. Then season with salt
and pepper, five tablespoons of catsup, three tablespoons of
vinegar; add one tablespoon each of grated onion and fine
chopped parsley. Serve on toast for breakfast.</p>

<h5>MINCEMEAT</h5>

<p>During the Xmas holidays open house was kept by the barons
and knights of the early days. Great festivities and merrymaking
was the order of the time. The great f&#234;te took place
on Xmas day. On that day the mistresses of the households
vied with each other in a friendly rivalry with their dishes of mutton pie.</p>

<p>The mutton pie, as it was known in 1596, is the mince pie
of to-day. It was also known by the name of Xmas pie or
shredds. In Herrick's time it was considered vitally important
to put an armed guard to watch the Xmas pies, lest some sweet-toothed
rascal purloin them and then there would be no pies
to grace the feast. As ever in warring lands, food commodities
were scarce and expensive and accordingly considered a great luxury.</p>


<h5>MINCEMEAT</h5>

<p>Mincemeat may now be prepared for the holidays; and if
kept in a cool place it will have sufficient time to blend and
ripen. Here are some inexpensive recipes:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of suet,</p>
<p>One-half cup of grated carrot,</p>
<p>Six cups of apples, chopped fine,</p>

<p>One-half cup of citron, chopped fine,</p>
<p>One-half cup of orange peel, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of cinnamon,</p>
<p>One-half tablespoon of nutmeg,</p>
<p>One-half tablespoon of cloves,</p>
<p>One and one-half cups of molasses,</p>
<p>One cup of boiled cider.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix in the order given. Pack into a bowl or crock. Cover
closely and then set in a cool place to ripen. Cold left-over meat may be used.</p>

<h5>EGGS</h5>

<p>The similarity in the proportion of the shell, yolk and white
of eggs in the chicken eggs is that the shell averages about one-tenth,
the yolk about three-fourths and the white about four-tenths.
The shell alone is counted as waste. The white contains
about six-eighths water, the solids of the white are virtually all
nitrogenous matter or protein. The yolk contains about one-half
water and one-third fat, and the balance is of nitrogenous matter or protein.</p>

<p>Newly laid or fresh eggs have a semi-transparent uniform,
pale pinkish tint; the shell contains a very small air chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg 278]</span>
which separates the skin and shell of the egg and is filled with
air. This chamber increases with the age of the egg.</p>

<p>Eggs when cooked at a low temperature are delicate and
easy to digest, and they can be used for invalids, and persons
with a delicate digestion.</p>


<h5>HOW TO COOK EGGS</h5>

<p>Eggs boiled are eggs spoiled; the physicians tell us that
hard-boiled eggs require three and a half hours to digest. Keep
this in mind when cooking eggs. Water boils at a temperature
of 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Eggs should be cooked at a temperature
between 165 and 185 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Place water in a saucepan and bring to a boil; boil for
three minutes and add the eggs. Place on the back of the stove
and let the eggs stand for eight minutes for a very soft boil and
twenty-five minutes for hard boiled. The water should be kept
hot&mdash;that is, just below the boiling point.</p>


<h5>FRIED EGGS</h5>

<p>Place the fat in the pan and heat until very hot and then
place where the pan will maintain this heat without getting
any hotter; if you use the gas turn down the burner. Add the
eggs. Let them cook very slowly until set and then turn if desired.
Eggs cooked in this way will not absorb the fat and will
be tender and delicate, and not have a crust of crisped egg around the edge.</p>


<h5>EGGS CARTHEOTH</h5>

<p>Tomatoes, peppers and pimentoes are generally used for this
dish. Prepare the tomatoes or peppers by cutting a slice from
the top and then hollowing out the centers. Break in an egg
and then season with salt and pepper and a little finely minced
parsley. Cover with two tablespoons of cream sauce. Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg 279]</span>
in the oven and bake for ten minutes. Finely minced ham or
bacon may be sprinkled over the egg before adding the cream sauce.</p>

<p>Cold cooked or left-over vegetables, such as corn, peas,
asparagus, onions or cauliflower, may be used also. Cold boiled
potatoes, beets, turnips, etc., may be made to do duty in place
of tomatoes, peppers or pimentos for the sake of variety. Serve
with a thick, highly seasoned sauce.</p>


<h5>POACHED EGGS</h5>

<p>To prepare poached eggs place water in a saucepan and
add one tablespoon of vinegar to each pint of water. Bring to
a boil and then open the egg on a saucer and slide into the
boiling water, let simmer slowly until it forms and then lift
with a skimmer on to a napkin to drain. Then roll gently
on a slice of buttered toast.</p>

<p>If you have any old-fashioned muffin rings place them flat
in the bottom of the saucepan and then pour the eggs in and
poach. Or you may use any of the poachers, that are sold in
any of the house-furnishing stores.</p>


<h5>OMELET</h5>

<p>Plain and fluffy omelets are cooked in the same manner as the fried eggs.</p>


<h5>PLAIN OMELET</h5>

<p>Place three tablespoons of shortening in a frying pan and
then, while heating, place the three eggs in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of milk,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat with a fork to thoroughly mix and then, when the pan
is smoking hot, turn in the mixture. Then place where the
omelet will cook very slowly. Season and then turn and fold
and roll, turning on a hot platter.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg 280]</span>


<h5>SPANISH OMELET</h5>

<p>Use the fluffy omelet recipe and then chop fine two medium-sized
tomatoes, drain free from the moisture and add one medium-sized
onion and four large olives, chopped fine. Place in a
small pan with one tablespoon of butter to heat. When hot
spread over the omelet and then fold and roll or place in a hot oven and bake.</p>


<h5>FLUFFY OMELET</h5>

<p>Separate the yolks and whites of three eggs. Place the
yolks in a bowl and add three tablespoons of milk. Beat to
thoroughly mix and then beat the whites until very stiff. Cut
and fold the yolks into the prepared whites and then turn into
a pan and cook slowly. Fold and roll and turn on a hot platter.</p>

<p>Fried eggs and omelets may be garnished with ham, bacon,
parsley, finely chopped; pimentos and green peppers.</p>

<p>To make variously flavored omelets, prepare the omelet as
for plain omelet and then just before the turning and rolling
add the desired flavoring. Then roll and fold the omelet and
turn out on a hot dish. Have the filling heated before spreading
on the omelet. Left-over vegetables and bits of meat may
be used in this manner for attractive dishes.</p>


<h5>TIGER-EYE SANDWICHES</h5>

<p>Use strictly fresh eggs for this. Separate the white and
the yolk and keep the yolk in the shell until ready for use. Add
a pinch of salt to the white and beat until very stiff. Pile in a
pyramid on a square slice of toast. Make a well in the centre of
the white of egg and then drop in the yolk. Dust over lightly
with paprika and then bake for seven minutes in a hot oven.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg 281]</span>


<h5>MEASUREMENTS</h5>

<p>Many women are familiar with the importance of accurate
measurements in preparing foods. Others frequently complain
of the troubles they have with recipes, but what they actually
need to know is that we no longer live in the days of twenty-five
cents a dozen for fresh eggs and that the day of thirty cents per
pound for creamery butter of excellent quality is past.</p>

<p>Gone are the days of plenty when the extravagant cook
was the best cook. Banish all recipes that call for cups of butter.</p>

<p>From motives of real practical economy, we now use level
measurements; that means that you first sift your flour into
a bowl and then fill the measure, using a spoon to fill with and
then level the top of the measure with a knife. Level measurement
means all that lies below the edge of the cup or spoon.</p>

<p>The experienced cook with an eye for measurements can
gauge the amounts, very frequently, to a nicety. While she may
sometimes have a failure, she will never attribute it to her measure
or the method of compounding the ingredients; oftentimes
she will blame the flour, the baking powder or even the oven.</p>

<p>One woman wrote me that she wished to know what the
trouble was with her cakes. I asked her to give the recipe and she
answered that she generally used a bowl for measuring and that
then she used sugar, eggs, butter, flour and enough milk or water
to make a batter&mdash;there was no real definite amounts. When I
replied I told her that it was the measurements and methods
that she used that frequently caused a failure. But she was
sure that was not the case, for her cake was usually good, and it
was only once in a while that she had a failure. So I had quite
a time convincing her that accurate measurements will always
give the same results and assured success and that she could bake
the same cake 365 days in the year and not once have a failure.</p>

<p>To-day this woman would not return to the old way of
doing her cooking, and recently I had a little note from her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg 282]</span>
telling me to let the other middle-aged and young housewives,
too, know how necessary it is to be accurate.</p>

<p>You know it only takes a few minutes longer to measure
accurately, and then you are able to make that delicious
cake without a failure. No failures, no waste. Truly, the
words of "trusting to luck" should be taboo in the efficient woman's kitchen.</p>

<p>The temptation to add just a little more sugar, flour or
shortening to a recipe with the idea of improving it must be
eliminated if you wish to cook successfully. When using vegetable
oil in place of butter in making cakes cut down the quantity
of fat fully one-third. Many cake recipes contain too much fat.</p>

<p>When the amounts are less than one cup, frequently it
is easier to measure with a spoon. Remember all measures are level:</p>

<table summary="measures" align="center">
<tr><td align="left">Sixteen tablespoons                  </td><td align="right"> 1 cup</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Eight tablespoons                    </td><td align="right"> &#189; cup</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Four tablespoons                     </td><td align="right"> &#188; cup</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Five tablespoons plus one teaspoon&nbsp;   </td><td align="right"> &#8531; cup</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Sift the flour once before measuring. Standard measuring
cups holding one-half pint are divided on one side into quarters
and on the other side into thirds, and they are usually found in
all housefurnishing stores, and there is a choice of aluminum, glass or tin.</p>

<p>Sets of measuring spoons will save time and trouble. The
spoons graduate from one-quarter of a teaspoon to one tablespoon,
thus making accurate measurements for seasoning and flavoring.</p>

<p>A spatula will repay its cost many times over the first month
it is used. It is possible with this knife to remove every particle
of food from a mixing bowl.</p>

<p>How can you keep a house without a pair of reliable scales?
Do you know how much the chicken weighed that you bought
on Saturday, and do you know how much waste there was;
or the weight of the bone in the meat that you purchased on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg 283]</span>
Wednesday? Do you ever weigh your purchases? Think this
over and then buy a good pair of scales and keep them in a convenient place.</p>

<h5>VEAL</h5>

<p>Veal is the dressed carcass of the calf. The flesh should be
firm, pinkish white and should be well cooked to develop its
flavor and nutritious qualities. The cuts are the neck, shoulders,
rack, breast, loin and leg. The shoulders, breast and loin
are used for roasting, the neck and end of the leg for stewing,
the leg for cutlets and the rack for chops. The knuckle from
the leg of veal may be used for stews, soups, stock or pepper pot.</p>

<p>Other products from the calf are heads, brains, hearts,
sweetbreads, feet, calves' liver, tripe, kidney and tongue. The
kidneys are usually left in the loin.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg 289]</span>


<h5>TO COOK</h5>

<p>The shoulder may be boned and rolled or left plain or just
remove the blade bone and then use a filling. The breast may
have the bones removed and then a pocket made and filled.</p>

<p>To roast the loin trim and tie into shape and then roast.</p>

<p>Meat from the neck, breast and knuckle is frequently used
with chicken and, if properly prepared, it is delicious. Stock
made from veal bones is rich in gelatine and may be used for
meat loaves, moulds and aspics.</p>


<h5>TO PREPARE BREADED CUTLETS</h5>

<p>Cut the cutlets into suitable pieces and then roll in flour
and dip in beaten egg, and then dip again in fine bread crumbs,
patting firmly. Fry quickly to a golden brown. Place in a
hot oven to finish cooking. The cutlet may be served with
either brown gravy or tomato sauce.</p>

<h5>TURTLE AND SNAPPER</h5>

<p>Lay the turtle on its back and cut off the head. Let turtle
bleed for twenty minutes. Separate the body from the shell
and remove the entrails. Carefully separate the liver and heart.
Now, with a sharp knife, remove the meat from the shell and
lay in boiling water for two minutes. Drain. Rub the legs and
all flesh containing the outer skin until the skin is removed, with
a coarse towel. Now, with a cleaver, chop the shell into five
pieces and place in scalding water for five minutes. Remove
from hot water. Use the knife to peel off the skin and bristle
from the shell. Now lay the meat and shell in cold water for
one and one-half hours. You now have white and green turtle meat ready to cook.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg 293]</span>

bring to a boil. Cook slowly until the meat is tender and then
remove the white meat. Cook the green meat, most of which is
in the shell, until it is tender. Place the meat, when tender, in
cold water to blanch. Use the liquid for soup. Strain and add
part of the turtle meat, hard-boiled egg, grated lemon rind and
juice of lemon. Prepare the snapper same as green turtle.
Only bleed snapper ten minutes.</p>


<h5>SHRIMP SALAD</h5>

minutes, then drain and cool. Remove the shells and then they
may be used for salads, croquettes and fried shrimps.</p>


<h5>TERRAPIN</h5>

<p>Diamond back or salt water terrapin are best. Fresh water
terrapin may be used for croquettes and puree. Clean the terrapin
by placing in fresh water for six hours. Wash in warm
water and then place them alive in boiling water. Cook for five
minutes. Remove and then rub with a coarse cloth the neck,
legs and tail to remove the skin. Wash again. Return to the
pot. Cook until the legs leave the body easily. Usually about
thirty-five minutes for small terrapin and seventy-five minutes
for large ones. The age and condition determine the time of
cooking. Cool. Now, before it is entirely cold, separate the
terrapin from the shell, discard the small intestines, shell, gall,
etc. Cut the meat into pieces.</p>

<p>Cook in cream sauce for a la Maryland; in brown sauce for
a la mode or stewed terrapin.</p>

<h4>STEAKS</h4>


<p>The selection of steak depends entirely upon the number of
persons to be served. A steak cannot be classed as a cheap
meat; the portions of bone and trimming makes this meat a rare
luxury in these times of high prices.</p>

<p>Yet there come times when the men folk want steak&mdash;and
steak it must be. There are three kinds of meats that are cut
into steaks; namely, the loin, rump and round. All three will
make delicious eating if properly prepared.</p>

<p>The round steak has the least waste, and if steaks are taken
from the first three cuts they should be tender and juicy, providing
they are cut sufficiently thick and are properly cooked.</p>

<p>The rump steak is fully as tender and palatable as loin and
it contains about one-third less waste. The sirloin is the
choicest cut in the whole carcass and it contains a proportionately
large amount of waste.</p>

<p>Have the butcher cut the round steak one-half inch thick
and then pound it with a meat ax to break the tough tissues.
Place on a platter and brush with salad oil and let stand for
one-half hour. Now broil in the usual manner, turning every
four minutes. Lift to a hot platter and spread with choice
meat butters given below.</p>

<p>Rump steak should be cut two inches thick and the bone
and fat trimmed. Now nick and score the edge of the fat and
brush with salad oil, and then broil the same as for round steak.</p>

<p>The sirloin steak should be cut two inches thick. Have the
butcher remove the chine bone and then the flank end. Let
him add a piece of suet to the flank end; then put it through the
food chopper for hamburg steak. It is a mistake to cook the
flank with the sirloin. Brush the steak with salad oil and then
broil. Lift to a hot platter.</p>

<p>Place one pint of water and one tablespoonful of salt in
the bottom of the broiling pan to prevent the fat drippings from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>
taking fire. Turn the meat every four minutes, so that it makes
the cooking even. To test the meat when broiling press with a
knife; if it is soft and spongy it is raw. Watch carefully and
when just beginning to become firm it is rare. Allow four
minutes for medium and six minutes for well done.</p>

<p>Do not turn the meat with a fork. The intense heat has
sealed or seared the surface and caused the meat to retain its
juices, and if you use a fork to turn it you will puncture or
make an opening so that these juices will escape.</p>

<p>A two-pound steak will be cooked rare in twelve minutes,
medium in fifteen minutes and well done in eighteen minutes.
Always lift to a hot platter.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One green pepper, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Two leeks, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Eight branches of parsley, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Two onions, chopped fine,</p>
<p>Ten branches of tarragon, chopped fine,</p>
<p>One-half cup of chives, chopped fine.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place four tablespoonfuls of shortening or vegetable oil in
a frying pan and add the herbs and cook very slowly until soft,
taking care not to brown. Now season with salt, pepper and
dress on a hot platter in a little mound at the bottom of the
steak. Garnish with a slice of lemon.</p>

<h5>ENGLISH BUTTER</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of butter,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of white pepper,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a paste and then spread on a steak as soon as you place it on the platter.</p>


<h5>LONDON BUTTER</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of melted butter,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of pepper,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of lemon juice.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and then pour over the steak.</p>


<h5>SWISS BUTTER</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of grated onion,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of finely minced parsley,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One and one-half tablespoons of butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth paste.</p>


<h5>ITALIAN BUTTER</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One green pepper, chopped very fine,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth paste and then spread on the meat.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>


<h5>VEGETABLE GARNISH</h5>

<p>Carrots, turnips and parsnips may be cut into cubes and
then shaped like a cork. Cook until tender in boiling water and
then brown quickly in a little hot fat. Beets and turnips may
be cooked until tender and then scoop out the centres and fill
with onions or cucumber mayonnaise.</p>


<h5>BROILED HAMBURG STEAK</h5>

<p>Do not fry or pan hamburg steak made from flank of sirloin.
Place meat in bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three-quarters cup of moist bread crumbs,</p>
<p>One onion, minced fine,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix, form into flat cakes, brush with salad oil; place on
baking dish. Broil in gas broiler for eight minutes, then place
in hot oven for seven minutes longer. Spread with desired butter
and send to the table in a baking dish. This will give a delicious
flavored meat in place of the usual dry, tasteless cake
that is frequently served.</p>


<h5>SALADS</h5>

<p>Salads are a popular summer dish. They should be made
from fresh vegetables which contain the health-giving elements
that are so vitally essential for our physical well-being. There
are also the mineral salts which help purify the blood stream
and thus keep us physically fit.</p>

<p>Eggs, etc., that are used in preparing the dressings have a
food value that may be figured upon in our daily ration. Heavy
salads, composed of meat, are best to be eliminated for the hot
weather. Replace them with light, dainty, attractive salads,
that are not only appetizing but also easily digested.</p>

<p>The making of a successful salad is an art indeed. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span>
proper blending of the various ingredients and then using a
well-blended dressing and garnishing, so that it will not only
satisfy the eye but will tempt the palate as well; that is a real salad.</p>

<p>The proper combinations are very important; harmony must
prevail. As, for instance, a combination of beets, tomatoes and
carrots would not only be inartistic but also a poor combination
of foods. Care must be taken in preparing the lettuce or
other greens used. All plants that form into heads must be
separately and thoroughly washed in order to free them from
dirt and insects, and then they should be given a final washing
in water that contains one tablespoon of salt to every two
quarts, then rinsed in ice water. The bath in salt water will
remove the tiny and almost invisible mites and slugs that cling to these greens.</p>

<p>Many varieties of salad dressing may be prepared from mayonnaise
or from the dressing purchased in bottles. When the
housewife fails to make a good mayonnaise dressing, or the
family is small, a good standard dressing already prepared may
be purchased and used in the following recipes:</p>


<h5>RUSSIAN DRESSING</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of salad dressing, or mayonnaise,</p>
<p>One raw beet,</p>
<p>One raw carrot,</p>
<p>One raw onion.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Pare and then grate the vegetables into the salad dressing and then add:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of sugar,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of mustard.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix and then use. This dressing will keep for a
week, if it is placed in a bottle and stored in a cool place.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>


<h5>FRENCH DRESSING</h5>

<p>Place in a bottle:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of salad oil,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of vinegar or lemon juice,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of pepper.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Shake until creamy and then store in a cool place. This
will keep well until used.</p>


<h5>ROQUEFORT DRESSING</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of Roquefort cheese,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of lemon juice,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of salad oil.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix smooth and serve.</p>


<h5>BOILED DRESSING</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of vinegar,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of water,</p>
<p>Three level tablespoons of cornstarch.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Dissolve the starch in the water and bring to a boil. Cook
for five minutes and then add:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One well-beaten egg,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of salad oil,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat till thoroughly mixed and then cook slowly for three
minutes. Pour into jars or jelly glasses and thin out with
cream or evaporated milk when using.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>


<h5>PIMENTO DRESSING</h5>

<p>Add four finely chopped pimentoes to one-half cup of prepared salad dressing.</p>


<h5>PAPRIKA DRESSING</h5>

<p>Add one and one-half teaspoons of paprika to the French
dressing. Shake well to blend. Paprika is a sweet, mild, red
pepper that will not bite the tongue.</p>

<p>During the warm weather use salads twice a day, beginning
the day with water-cress, radishes or crisp young onions or
leaves of lettuce for your health's sake.</p>


<h5>BLOND FRENCH DRESSING</h5>

<p>Place in a wide mouthed bottle,</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One teaspoon of sugar, </p>
<p>One teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of white wine vinegar,</p>
<p>One-half cup of vegetable salad oil.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Shake until creamy.</p>

<p>The use of paprika is decidedly better than the pungent
pepper. This pepper is mildly sweet-flavored spice that does
not irritate the delicate lining of the throat or stomach. Now,
fully as important as the green appetizers are the dainty salads,
lettuce, corn salad, endive, romaine, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers,
cabbage and the cooked vegetables, such as lima beans,
peas, string beans, beets, etc.</p>

<p>The success of salads depends entirely on the dressings used
with them. So, with this in mind, we will now prepare some
delicious dressings. Place in a fruit jar and then put them in
the ice box, where they can be had at a minute's notice.</p>

<p>You know that often when you come home just fagged out,
when perhaps you did not take the time to get luncheon, a cool,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
crisp salad and some thinly sliced buttered bread and a cup
of tea will not only satisfy and refresh you, but will also prevent a headache.</p>


<h5>A LA MODE CANADIENNE</h5>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Shake until well blended and then pour over the salad as you serve it.</p>

<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of mustard.</p>

<h5>MEATS</h5>

<p>In order to purchase meats intelligently so that we will receive
the best value for money expended, it is necessary to know
the nature of the cuts, and especially the proportionate amounts
of lean meat, fat and bone that they contain; also the approximate
food values of the meat obtained from various parts of the carcass.</p>


<h5>HIND QUARTERS</h5>

<p>Loin steak average 57 per cent. lean, 33 per cent. visible
fat, 10 per cent. bone. Sirloin steaks in general contain a larger
percentage of lean meat and a smaller amount of fat than the
porterhouse or club steaks.</p>

<p>Rib cuts contain 52 per cent. lean meat, 31 per cent. fat,
17 per cent. bone. The greatest percentage of lean meat is
found in the sixth rib, and the smallest in the eleventh and twelfth rib cuts.</p>

<p>Round steaks are meat cut from the round. They average
67 per cent. lean meat, 20 per cent. fat and 16 per cent. bone.
The round steaks contain 73 per cent. to 84 per cent. lean meat.</p>

<p>The rump contains 49 per cent. lean meat, the round as a pot
roast contains about 86 per cent. lean meat; the largest percentage
of fat is found in the rump roast. Soup bones contain
from 8 per cent. to 60 per cent. lean meat.</p>


<h5>THE FOREQUARTERS</h5>

<p>The forequarters of beef contain the chuck, the shoulder,
clod, neck and shank. The chuck contains 67 per cent. lean
meat, 20 per cent. fat and 12 per cent. bone. Chuck steak
varies from 60 per cent. to 80 per cent. lean and from 8 per
cent, to 24 per cent. fat.</p>

<p>The clod or bolar cut contains 82 per cent. lean meat and 5 per cent. bone.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg 309]</span>

<p>Relatively more lean and less fat meat is found in the chuck
rib roast than in the cut from the prime rib roast.</p>

<p>The navel, brisket and rib ends average 52 per cent. lean
meat, 40 per cent. fat and 8 per cent. bone. The brisket and
navel cuts are similar in proportion, while the rib ends slightly
higher in percentage of bone and less lean.</p>

<p>Flank steak contains 85 per cent. lean meat and 15 per cent.
fat. Shank cuts or soup bones from the shank vary from 15
per cent. to 67 per cent. lean meat and from 25 per cent. to
76 per cent. bone, while the boneless shank, used for stews,
goulashes, hashes and minces, contain 85 per cent. lean meat and 15 per cent. fat.</p>

<p>The trimmings from the loin, in steaks reduce their weights
about 13 per cent. and these trimmings average 4.6 per cent.
fat and 2 per cent. bone. Round steak is reduced about 7 per
cent. in weight in trimmings, principally in fat; chuck steaks
about 6&#189; per cent., principally bone.</p>

<p>Rump, shoulder, pot roast and neck are all materially reduced
in weight by fat and bone trimmings, the size and condition
of the animal determining the actual amounts. The actual
proportion of lean meat, fat and bone in the various cuts, their
relative values of economy, fixes the prices to the consumer.</p>

<p>Taking the cuts of meat in their right order we have:</p>

<p>First, the neck for soup, stews and corning. The cost is
very low and the waste is considerable.</p>

<p>Second, the chuck. This includes the entire shoulder and
contains five ribs. The first two ribs are usually sold as
shoulder, roast and steak, and while they are about the same
quality as No. 9, they cost considerably less.</p>

<p>Third, the shoulder clod. This is part of the chuck and
can be purchased in almost all markets. The price is low and
there is no waste. It is used principally for steaks and pot
roasts. When used for steaks, score the meat well.</p>

<p>Fourth, shank. According to the market price, this is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg 310]</span>
the cheapest part of the beef. However, it contains 54 per cent.
to 57 per cent. waste and requires long cooking. It is used for soups and stews.</p>

<p>Fifth, ribs. Contains eight ribs; five of these are the prime
cuts and used for roasting exclusively.</p>

<p>Sixth, sirloin. The loin, some cuts contain as low as 3 per
cent, waste. The sirloin is tender; therefore, quickly and easily
cooked. For this reason it is one of the most popular cuts.</p>

<p>Seventh, porterhouse. This portion of the loin contains
the choicest steaks, excellent and nutritious and easily cooked.
The fillet or tenderloin forms a part of the loin and averages
about 13 per cent. waste.</p>

<p>Eighth, rump. This cut is very nutritious, but requires
careful cooking to render it tender; it contains slightly more
waste than the round. Good steaks are obtained from the rump;
it is also used for pot roast braising and coming.</p>

<p>Ninth, pin bone, the middle portion of the loin. It is of excellent
quality, tender and of good flavor and quite as popular
as the loin. It is the face cut of the rump.</p>

<p>Tenth, round. An inexpensive cut, containing only 7 per
cent, waste. It is nutritious as tenderloin, but not as tender.
The first essential in cooking is to sear the outside in order to
retain the juices and then cook slowly until tender.</p>

<p>Steak and roast are cut from the round and the back or
heel and is used for pot roast and stews.</p>

<p>One factor in helping to keep up the high prices of food is
that the average woman, <i>when she goes to market, has in mind</i>
fancy price and choice cuts for roast, steaks and chops. The
choice cuts represent about 26 per cent. of the whole carcass,
leaving about 74 per cent. to be disposed of. Now, if this becomes
difficult, the fancy cuts must bear the additional cost
and so become proportionately high in price.</p>

<p>Take a cross cut of beef, weighing about six pounds and
wipe with a damp cloth, and one-half cupful of flour patted into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id="page311"></a>[pg 311]</span>
it and then brown quickly on both sides in a frying pan and then
place in a fireless cooker or a moderate oven together with</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two medium-sized onions,</p>
<p>One carrot, cut in quarters,</p>
<p>One and one-half cups of boiling water,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and cook slowly, allowing one-half hour for the meat to start
cooking and then twenty-five minutes to the pound. Baste frequently.
If baked in the range it should give a delicious, well-flavored
roast, that will supply the most finicky family with a good substantial food.</p>

<p>The bolar cut from the shoulder may be prepared the same way.</p>

<p>Meat from the neck and shin may be used for stews, goulashes and meat loaves.</p>


<h5>POT ROAST OF SHIN BEEF, ENGLISH STYLE</h5>

<p>Have the butcher cut a piece of beef from the upper part
of the shin, with the bone in. Wipe with a damp cloth and then
pat in one-half cupful of flour. Brown quickly on both sides
and then lift to a deep saucepan and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One large turnip, cut in quarters,</p>
<p>One large carrot, cut in quarters,</p>
<p>One faggot of soup herbs,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of sweet marjoram,</p>
<p>Two cups of boiling water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cover closely and cook slowly until the meat is tender, allowing
one-half hour for meat to start cooking and twenty-five
minutes to the pound, counting the time when it is put into the kettle.</p>

<p>The plate and brisket may be used for soups, stews and
goulashes and for corning. The brisket makes a splendid pot
roast when boned and rolled. Also the plate or brisket may be used for &#224; la mode.</p>

<p>The flank steak is a choice piece of lean, boneless meat that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span>
lies close to the ribs and weighs from one and three-quarters
to two and one-half pounds. It may be used for steaks, if cut
in slanting slices or for mock fillet or rolled or for hamburg steak.</p>

<p>When boiling or stewing meat, keep this in mind: Meat to
be palatable and juicy must contain nutriment; it must be
plunged into boiling water to seal the surface, by coagulating
the albumen in the meat; and then it should be cooked just below
the boiling point until tender, allowing one-half hour for the
meat to heat and start cooking and then twenty-five minutes to
the pound. Add salt just before removing from the fire.</p>

<p>Keep this fact in mind, that salt will, if added when the meat
is just starting to cook, extract the juice.</p>

<p>For pot roast and braises, etc., it is necessary to quickly
sear over the surface of the meat for the same reason that the
meat was plunged into boiling water and then cook slowly, allowing
the same proportion of time as for boiling or stewing.</p>

<p>The real object in cooking meat is to retain the juices and
make it sufficiently to eat and increase its flavor.</p>

<h5>PLANKED STEAK</h5>

<p>Have the butcher cut the steak in two and one-half inch
thicknesses from the large end of the sirloin. Remove the flank
end and then the tenderloin, also taking out the bones. The
butcher will do this for you. Now, when ready to prepare the
steak, soak the plank in cold water for one hour. Heat the
broiler and then place the plank in the oven. Cook the steak
until quite rare in the broiler and then lift to a hot plank. Prepare
a border of mashed potatoes and put them in a pastry bag,
forced out around the edge of the plank. Garnish and smother

<h5>DELMONICO ROAST BEEF</h5>

<p>Have the butcher cut the seventh and eighth rib from a
roast, removing the chine bone. Now have him remove the blade
and meat between it and the skin, cutting off the top of the ribs.
This gives you a heart-shaped piece of very tender beef. It is
really the eye of these two ribs. Place the roast in a pan and
dust lightly with flour, and then place in a hot oven for thirty
minutes to start cooking. Now reduce the heat and cook, allowing
twenty minutes to the pound, counting the time from the
minute you reduce the heat.</p>

<p>Use the top of the ribs and the piece of meat from the blade
for the pot roast or a beef &#224; la mode. Have the butcher remove
the blade and roll the flap-like piece around the ribs, fastening
it with a skewer or the entire piece may be boned and rolled.</p>


<h5>BAKED SLICE OF HAM</h5>

<p>Have the butcher cut the ham in one-inch thick slices.

prevent curling. Place on a baking dish and pour over the ham</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Two tablespoons of syrup.</p>

<h5>ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB</h5>

<p>Have the butcher bone and roll the shoulder and then when
ready to use wipe with a damp cloth and pack with the following
mixture: Chop very fine</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three onions,</p>
<p>Four branches of parsley,</p>
<p>One leek.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Pat with flour and then roast in the oven, allowing thirty
minutes to start cooking and twenty minutes to the pound,
gross weight. Baste the meat after it commences to brown with
one and one-half cups of boiling water.</p>

<p>The season for spring lamb is from January to July.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg 323]</span>
The meat is delicate and while less nutritious than mutton is delicious.</p>

<p>Yearling is a splendid choice for lamb. It is fully as
nutritious as mutton, without the excess fat of mutton. Fat
mutton frequently disagrees with persons of delicate digestion
and therefore should be discarded from the menu, and the
yearling should be substituted.</p>

<p>The choice mutton is raised in Virginia, Pennsylvania and
North Carolina, while that which comes from Wisconsin is of
splendid quality. Canada also sends us some fine meat.</p>

<p>Prime mutton is large and heavy, the fat firm and white and
the flesh a deep red in color and very finely grained. This meat
contains fully as much nutriment as beef.</p>

<p>Soups and broths made from mutton when the fat is removed
are very wholesome and are frequently ordered in diets by
physicians. Mutton should be hung for a short period to ripen,
but lamb should be used a short time after it is dressed.</p>

<p>The cuts in the side of lamb or mutton usually number six:
(1) The neck, (2) the chuck, which includes some of the ribs as
far as the shoulder blade, (3) the shoulder, (4) the flank or
breast, (5) the loin and (6) the leg.</p>

<p>In some parts of the country the butcher makes a cut, using
the rack end of the loin and chuck for making the rib or French
chops. The term chops is intended to designate meat cut from
the rack or loin into chops, preferably one and one-quarter
inches thick. Where the meat is cut with nine ribs on the loin,
the shoulder and balance of the chuck is cut into chops for panning
or braising. These chops require longer time for cooking
than those cut from the rack or loin.</p>


<h5>ACCOMPANIMENTS FOR LAMB AND MUTTON</h5>

<p>Serve with a roast shoulder or leg of lamb, mint sauce, green
grape jelly, peas or asparagus and baked potatoes. With mutton
or lamb chops serve green grape jelly, mint or currant jelly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg 324]</span>

<p>Mutton may be boiled and served with caper or soubis
(onions) sauces, currant jelly sauce, boiled or mashed potatoes,
peas, string beans, asparagus, stuffed tomatoes and cole slaw.</p>


<h5>HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LAMB AND MUTTON</h5>

<p>Look first at the joint above the hoof. In lamb this joint
is serrated or tooth-shaped when broken, while in the yearling
and mutton it is the smooth oval ball-and-socket joint. In
lamb the bones are pinkish in color; in mutton the bones are a
blue-white color. The pinkish colored skin should be removed
from lamb and yearling before cooking. This skin contains the woolly flavor.</p>


<h5>BONE AND STUFFED SHOULDER OF LAMB</h5>

<p>Have the butcher bone the shoulder of lamb and then wipe
with a damp cloth. Now prepare a filling as follows: Mince
fine sufficient parsley to measure one-half cup. Place in a bowl and add</p>

boiling water. Reduce the heat to a moderate oven.</p>

<p>The time to cook: Allow the meat thirty minutes for heating,
so as to start cooking, and then twenty minutes to the
pound, counting gross weight.</p>

<p>Keep the fact in mind that the rolled and filled meat requires
more time than just the plain shoulder.</p>

<h4>HOW TO PREPARE RECIPES</h4>


<h5>POPOVERS</h5>

<p>Place the popover pans in the oven to heat. Break one egg
in a measuring cup and then fill with milk and turn into the mixing bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One cup of sifted flour.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat with a Dover egg-beater for five minutes and then remove
the smoking hot popover pans from the oven and grease
well. Pour in the batter and place at once in a hot oven and
bake for thirty-five minutes. Do not open the oven door for
ten minutes after the popovers are placed in the oven. When
the popovers are twenty-five minutes in the oven, turn down the
gas and then bake slowly to thoroughly dry out for the balance
of the time allowed for baking.</p>

<p>This amount will make eight small or six large popovers.
Now, while the popovers are baking, the creamed beef can be
prepared. Cut one-quarter pound of dried beef fine, using a
pair of scissors to cut with. Place in a pan and cover with
boiling water and let stand for five minutes. Drain and
then make a cream sauce as follows:</p>

<p>Place one and one-half cups of milk in a saucepan and add
six tablespoons of flour and stir to dissolve, and then bring to
a boil and cook for three minutes. Add the prepared dried
beef and two tablespoons of finely minced parsley and let simmer
slowly until the popovers are ready.</p>

<p>Cut a slice from the tops of the popovers and fill them with
the prepared creamed beef. Place a tiny dot of butter on top
of each popover and dust lightly with paprika.</p>


<h5>KIDNEY PIE</h5>

<p>The meat pie can be made to be an economical dish. These
pies are served in the Chelsea Coffee House in London.</p>

<p>Remove the fat and tubes from one large beef kidney and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id="page330"></a>[pg 330]</span>
then cut into pieces the size of a walnut. Place in a saucepan
and add three cups of boiling water and let simmer slowly for
ten minutes. Turn into a colander and let the cold water run
on the kidney for five minutes. Now return the kidney to the saucepan and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half teaspoon of thyme,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of sweet marjoram,</p>
<p>Four onions, cut in pieces.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook slowly until tender and then add sufficient boiling water
to cover. Add the dumplings, made as follows: Strain gravy
from the kidney and add sufficient water to measure three and
one-half cups. Place in a saucepan and when boiling add the
dumplings, made as follows. Place in a mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of mashed potatoes,</p>
<p>One cup of flour,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of baking powder,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of grated onion,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of finely-minced parsley,</p>
<p>One egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth paste and then form into balls the size
of a large walnut, and drop into the prepared stock and cook
for ten minutes. Lift and thicken the gravy slightly. Now
make a pastry as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift and then add the one-half pound of finely chopped suet
and rub it into the flour well. Mix to a dough with two-thirds
cup of water and roll out one-quarter inch thick on a floured
pastry board. Line a large baking dish or individual custard
cups. Now put a layer of kidney in the bottom and season
with salt, pepper and finely minced onion. Place a dumpling on
top and then a layer of thinly sliced hard-boiled egg. Cover
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg 331]</span>
with well-seasoned gravy and then with a crust, brushing the
edges of the crust well with water. Now cut two gashes in the
top of the crust to permit the steam to escape and then brush
the top with water. If a large pie, bake for one hour; if individual
ones, bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes.
Use three eggs in the kidney pie.</p>


<h5>ORANGE PUDDING</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

  </div>  </div>

boil and cook for three minutes and serve.</p>


<h5>RICE CROQUETTES WITH CREAM BEEF</h5>

<p>Mould well-seasoned cooked rice into croquettes; then dip
and flour and brown in hot fat.</p>

<p>Six tablespoons of brown sugar,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of flour,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of nutmeg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix well and then spread on the shortcake and bake in a
moderate oven for thirty minutes. Much of the actual preparation
of the menu can be prepared on Saturday.</p>

<p>Use yolk of one egg for making dressing for coleslaw. For orange cake use</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>White of one egg,</p>
<p>One-half glass of jelly.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in a bowl and beat until mixture holds its shape. Pile on orange shortcake.</p>




<h4>HALLOWE'EN</h4>


<p>On Hallowe'en the good fairies are permitted to make themselves
visible to their many friends&mdash;so the traditions of Ireland
tell us. And the little ones, as they are called by the
romantic fun-loving Irish nation, play a great many tricks
this night on their enemies and they reward their true friends with many blessings.</p>

<p>It is truly a wonderful night for the romantic maiden to
delve into the future and find, or try to find, her luck when
seeking for the knowledge of her future life partner. In those
good old days of long ago, the lad and lassie spent a pleasant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id="page333"></a>[pg 333]</span>
evening trying all the lucky spells to insure them success in
their love affairs for the coming year.</p>

<p>And in the midst of much hilarity many games are played;
there are bobbing and ducking for apples, spinning the plate,
post-office, heavy, heavy, what hangs over and forfeits. These
were some of the old-fashioned ways the boys and girls of yesteryear
passed a happy evening.</p>

<p>Other old legends told that this one night in the year the
spooks or ghosts were permitted to roam the earth, so that, to
escape their notice, all must go masked&mdash;hence our young folk
disguised themselves and wandered forth from house to house,
seeking entertainment; for many informal parties were held on
this eve and no one was refused admission; each visitor was
treated to apples and nuts and then he wandered on his way.</p>

<p>Let your young folk entertain their friends with a good
old-fashioned Hallowe'en party; let them play the old games of
long ago, and then close to the magic hour of midnight serve a
real old-fashioned Hallowe'en supper.</p>

<p>A nice change for the family is to give them corn muffins
and plain rolls or biscuits in place of bread. Usually in the
hurry and bustle of getting the business folk off in time in the
morning and then preparing the children for school the housewife
does not have the time to prepare these homey, old-fashioned breads for breakfast.</p>

<p>The price of butter makes it almost prohibitive to use it as
a spread for hot cakes, yet we all like the butter flavor. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>[pg 339]</span>
let us follow the example of the thrifty New England woman,
who puts the syrup into a good-sized pitcher and then adds two
tablespoons of butter to one and one-half cups of syrup. Place
the pitcher into a pan of warm water and then heat. Stir frequently,
so that the butter will melt and blend thoroughly with
the syrup. Just before sending to the table beat thoroughly.
This not only makes a delicious spread for hot cakes and waffles
and the like, but it is a real economy and a saving in butter.</p>


<h5>GRAPE-JUICE COCKTAIL</h5>

<p>Place one pound of grapes in a saucepan and add three
cups of water. Bring to a boil and cook until soft. Rub
through a fine sieve and then sweeten and chill. Fill into cocktail
glasses and serve.</p>


<h5>POT ROAST BEEF, SPANISH</h5>

<p>Place in a mixing bowl and chop fine</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tomatoes,</p>
<p>Four onions,</p>
<p>Three green peppers,</p>
<p>Four branches of parsley.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One teaspoon of paprika.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and pack into the meat, pushing well into the roll. Roll
the meat in flour and then melt the suet in a deep saucepan and
add the meat. Brown well and add one-half cup of flour. Stir
until well browned and then add one quart of boiling water.
Cover closely and then cook, allowing one-half hour for each
pound of meat, gross weight. One hour before cooking add
six small onions and one carrot cut in quarters.</p>

<p>When ready to serve, add one quart of boiling water and
season to taste. This will provide sufficient gravy to use for two meals.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg 340]</span>

  </div>  </div>

<p>Two and one-half cups of flour,</p>
<p>Two level tablespoons of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard to mix and then bake on a hot griddle.</p>


<h5>BUTTERED AND SPICED BEETS</h5>

<h5>YE OLD-TYME OYSTER PYE</h5>

<p>To prepare the crust, place in a mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of sifted flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift to mix and then put one-quarter pound of suet through
the food-chopper. Then rub the finely chopped suet through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>[pg 342]</span>
a fine sieve to remove the stringy parts. Now rub the suet into
the flour and mix to a dough with one-half cup of cold water.
Then chop and fold for two minutes. Turn on a floured pastry
board and divide into two pieces. Roll out one-half of the
dough until one-quarter inch thick and then turn a large plate
over this dough and cut around the edge of the plate. Be sure
that the plate is at least two inches larger than the top of the
baking or casserole dish.</p>

<p>Now drain the oysters and look over carefully for the bits
of shell. Place the oysters in a casserole or baking dish and
add the stalk of celery that has been scraped clean and then
diced and cooked until tender, also</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One grated onion,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of parsley,</p>
<p>Three cups of thick cream sauce,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of white pepper,</p>
<p>One-eighth teaspoon of thyme.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly and then make two or three small gashes
in the top of the crust and cover the oysters with it, pressing
the crust well against the edges of the dish. Brush the top
of crust with water and bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Use equal parts of the oyster liquor and milk for making
the cream sauce. Chop the celery leaves as well as the stalk.</p>

<p>Now roll out the balance of the pastry and cut into three-inch
squares. Score the tops lightly with a knife or prick with
a fork, and place on a baking sheet and bake a delicate light
brown. Wrap in a napkin to keep warm. When ready to serve
the oyster pie, place two of the squares of pastry on a plate and
then lift on the oyster pie, and then place a second piece right
over the crust of pie. Pour over this top piece of pastry two
tablespoons of the sauce from the oyster pie.</p>

<h5>RAISIN CAKE</h5>

<p>Four teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of water.</p>

and floured loaf-shaped pan. Now spread one-half package
of raisins on top and gently press them with the back of the
spoon until the dough covers them. Bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes.</p>


<h5>TURKEY</h5>

<p>A creole method of roasting turkey, chicken, duck or game
or broiling fowl, birds or game is given below. Clean and prepare
the bird to suit the taste, and when ready to cook, whether
broiling, roasting or baking, lard the breast with many strips
of salt pork or bacon, or fastened on with toothpicks. Place
in a hot oven to sear, then turn the bird, be it large or small,
on its breast. Roast, bake or broil for three-quarters of the
time on its breast, basting every ten minutes. Dredge occasionally
with flour. Do not season at the beginning of cooking,
but delay this until the last quarter of the time allotted for
cooking the bird, then turn it on its breast to brown.</p>

<p>Finish cooking, basting every ten minutes. This method
permits the heat to cook the heaviest part of the bird slowly,
so that, by turning on its breast, the bony structure may receive the intense heat.</p>

<p>Birds or fowls that are old should be steamed before roasting.
This method will make them tender and juicy.</p>

<p>The good old-fashioned oyster soup, made from the famous
recipe that has been in the family for so many years, was served
from two immense old white china tureens. Grandpa Perkins,
sitting at the head of the table, ladled out the soup, and after
it was placed and every one was seated, grandpa rapped the
table with the big horn handle of the carving knife and every
head was bowed in silent prayer while his voice was uplifted in
thankful Thanksgiving praise, to which we all responded with a solemn amen.</p>

<p>Next come the fish balls&mdash;not the great, round old-fashioned
grease-soaked one of commerce, but the daintiest golden
brown balls the size of bantam eggs, fried in smoking hot fat
and laid on snowy white napkins in piles, with sprigs of parsley stuck between them.</p>

<h5>COUSIN HETTY'S FISH BALLS</h5>

<p>"Time was," said Cousin Hetty, "when we used to flake out
fish, but since brother and old Amos went into the fish business,
we generally use the shredded fish."</p>

<p>Recipe for six persons. Open a package of prepared
shredded codfish and then turn into a piece of cheese-cloth and
plunge four or five times into a large bowl of hot water. Squeeze
dry. Cook and then mash sufficient potatoes to measure three
cups and then add the prepared fish and</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of grated onion,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of finely-minced parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One-quarter cup of milk,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat hard to mix thoroughly and then mould into small
balls; roll in flour; dip in beaten egg and milk and then roll
in fine crumbs and fry until golden brown in hot fat.</p>


<h5>BANNOCKS</h5>

<p>For six persons. Place in a saucepan</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of boiling water,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of maple sugar,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of syrup,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of cornmeal.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook until it is a thick cornmeal mush, then let cool. Spread
very thin on well-greased baking sheet; brush with melted shortening
and bake in a hot oven. In the days of long ago these
bannocks were usually baked before the open fire.</p>

<p>The feature of the dinner, three large turkeys, were cooked
until golden brown and juicy tender. Nigh about the coming of
the first of October, grandma gives strict orders that every
morsel of bread crumbs, even though it is just the war bread,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354" id="page354"></a>[pg 354]</span>
be saved. For you know lots of bread crumbs are needed for
the fish cakes and then filling of the birds. This stale bread is
thoroughly dried out and then put through the food chopper,
then sifted. The coarse crumbs are used for filling the turkey.</p>

<p>In the good old days of yesteryear when a large majority
of us felt that Thanksgiving would be incomplete without the
turkey, it required careful planning to use the left-overs without
waste, as the family quickly tired of too much turkey when
served for three or four meals.</p>

<p>However, left-over chicken or turkey may be served in the following dishes:</p>


<h5>BROWN EMINCE FOWL</h5>

<p>Pick the meat from the back, carcass and neck and mince
fine the giblets. Place in a saucepan and add to one and one-half
cups of the prepared meat</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One onion,</p>
<p>One green pepper, minced fine,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of boiling water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cook gently for twenty-five minutes, then place in a saucepan
two tablespoons of shortening and four tablespoons of
flour. Stir to blend thoroughly and then brown until a rich
golden brown. Turn in the prepared emince and stir to mix and season with</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Salt,</p>
<p>White pepper,</p>
<p>Tiny pinch of mustard,</p>
<p>Tiny pinch of poultry seasoning.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Make a border of mashed potatoes on a warm platter and
fill the emince in the centre of the platter and garnish with finely minced parsley.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id="page355"></a>[pg 355]</span>


<h5>CHICKEN DUMPLINGS</h5>

<p>Remove all the meat from the left-over carcass and break
the bones. Place the bones in a stock pot and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three pints of cold water,</p>
<p>Two onions,</p>
<p>One faggot of potherbs,</p>
<p>One cup of well-crushed tomatoes.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and simmer slowly for two and one-half
hours. Strain the stock and season with</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Salt,</p>
<p>White pepper,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of finely-minced parsley.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Now place sufficient meat picked from the carcass through
the food chopped to measure, when chopped fine, one cup; place in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One large onion, grated,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of finely-chopped minced parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of white pepper,</p>
<p>Two cups of sifted flour,</p>
<p>Three level teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of shortening,</p>
<p>One well-beaten egg,</p>
<p>Seven tablespoons of water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth dough, then drop from the tablespoon
into boiling stock. Cover closely and let cook for fifteen minutes.
Lift on a slice of toast and then quickly add to the stock</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of minced chicken.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Then dissolve</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>and stir to blend thoroughly. Add to the stock and then
bring to a boil; cook for five minutes and pour over the dumplings.
Sprinkle with finely minced parsley and send to the table at once.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>[pg 356]</span>


<h5>CHICKEN LOAF</h5>

<p>This delightful old southern dish is always welcomed by
the family. Put the meat picked from the carcass and neck,
with the giblets, through the food chopper, about one and one-half
cups. Mince fine one-half cup of bacon and sufficient onions
to measure one cup. Brown the bacon and simmer the onions in
the bacon fat until tender, taking care not to brown. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two and one-half cups of cold cooked rice,</p>
<p>One cup of very thick cream sauce,</p>
<p>One cup of fine bread crumbs,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of white pepper,</p>
<p>One well-beaten egg.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly, then pack into well-greased and floured
loaf-shaped pan. Set the pan in a large one containing warm
water and bake for one hour in a slow oven. Remove the pan
containing the water and let the loaf stay in the moderate
oven for fifteen minutes. Serve with parsley, cream or tomato
sauce while hot; cut the balance cold and serve with mayonnaise or tartare sauce.</p>

<h5>ONION RELISH</h5>

<p>Chop fine sufficient onions to measure one cup and then
place two tablespoons of fat in a frying pan. When hot, add
the onions, cover closely and simmer slowly until tender. Season
with salt and paprika and three tablespoons of vinegar. Cool and serve as a relish.</p>


<h5>CURLY CELERY</h5>

<p>Scrape and thoroughly cleanse two stalks of celery and
remove part of the green top and the bruised outside pieces.
Cut each stalk in half from the root to the stem and then split
again. Place in cold water and allow to crisp and cool.</p>


<h5>GRANDMA PERKINS'S SPICY FILLING</h5>

<p>Put the green and rough outside parts of the celery</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four onions,</p>
<p>One bunch of potherbs,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>through the food chopper and chop fine; then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three cups of stale bread crumbs,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>Five tablespoons of shortening,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of pepper,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of chicken stock.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and then fill into the prepared chicken. Sew the opening
with a stout darning needle and string. Now rub the
chicken thoroughly with shortening and cover with flour. Place
in the oven and let brown slightly; then turn the chicken breast
down and baste every ten minutes. Turning the chicken with
the breast down causes the juices to permeate the white meat
and thus make it tender and juicy.</p>

<p>Turn the chicken and allow the breast about twenty minutes
for browning before taking from the oven.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id="page358"></a>[pg 358]</span>


<h5>BAKED CHICKEN</h5>

<p>Select a plump stewing chicken about five pounds and then
singe, draw and wash thoroughly. Cover slowly and steam until
tender; then fill with a spicy filling and place in a moderate
oven to roast for one and three-quarters hours, basting every ten minutes.</p>

<p>In order to be sure that the fowl will be sufficiently tender,
remember to steam it ahead of time.</p>


<h5>CRANBERRY JELLY</h5>

<p>Wash one pint of cranberries; then drain and place in a
saucepan. Add three-quarters cup of water. Cover and cook
until soft; then rub through a fine sieve. Add two cups of
brown sugar and bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes and
then pour into small custard cups to mould.</p>


<h5>SWEET POTATO PONE</h5>

<p>Wash and then boil one-quarter peck of sweet potatoes.
Cool and remove the skins. Place in a bowl and mash, seasoning with</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half teaspoon of nutmeg,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of pepper,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of butter.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Grease a baking pan well; then dust with flour and spread
the prepared sweet potatoes in the pan about one inch thick.
Sprinkle the top thickly with nutmeg and place one tablespoon
of butter over the top in tiny dots. Bake in a moderate oven for
twenty-five minutes. Remove from the oven and let stand for
five minutes. Cut into squares and lift with a cake turner to a hot plate.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg 359]</span>


<h5>COLESLAW</h5>

<p>Shred the cabbage fine and then chop one green pepper.
Place in water to crisp. Make a mayonnaise dressing by placing on a plate</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Yolk of one egg,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of sugar,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of vinegar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Work to a smooth paste and then add the oil slowly at
first and then faster until all the oil is thoroughly incorporated,
beating it quite hard. Add the salt to taste. Now add the
vinegar to reduce to desired consistency; then drain the cabbage,
turn on a cloth and let dry before pouring over the
dressing. Use three-quarters cup salad oil.</p>


<h5>MINCE PIE</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of flour,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of baking powder,</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in a mixing bowl and then sift. Now rub three-quarters
cup of shortening and mix to a dough with about six
tablespoons of water. Divide the dough, then roll out and
cover a pie plate. Use one and one-half pounds of mincemeat
to fill. Cover with a crust and then wash with beaten egg. Bake
in a moderate oven for forty-five minutes.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Note</span>.&mdash;To wash the pie use one-half of beaten egg, using
the balance in the chicken filling.</p>

<p>You know there is a great little story told about the pie-loving
New Englanders, and as the story goes, there are only
two kinds of pie, namely, "'Tis mince and 'tain't mince." So, as
Grandma Perkins says, "This is all mince."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id="page360"></a>[pg 360]</span>


<h5>HOW TO PREPARE THE MINCE</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Twelve medium-sized apples,</p>
<p>One-half pound of candied citron,</p>
<p>One-half package of seeded raisins,</p>
<p>One pound of shelled peanuts,</p>
<p>Three-quarters pound of suet,</p>
<p>One pound of dried peaches,</p>
<p>One lemon.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Put all through the food chopper and then place</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One quart of syrup,</p>
<p>One pound of brown sugar,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>in a preserving kettle and bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes
and then add the prepared fruits and suet that have been put
through the food chopper and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One package of seeded raisins,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of cinnamon,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of ginger,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of cloves,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of allspice,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of nutmeg,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>Three-quarters cup of strong cider vinegar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to mix thoroughly, then cook for ten minutes. Cool
and then fill into fruit jars. Pour one tablespoon of salad oil
on top; adjust the rubber and lid and seal. Process in hot
water bath for twenty minutes and then cool and store.</p>

<p>This mince will be found to be most delicious, and it will
keep until used. Grandma Perkins's grandad was a Hiram
Teesdale, of Gloucester, England, and this recipe is over 400
years old. The original recipe was named Christmas Mynce
Pye, and on the holidays, a great pye of Gloucester mynce, made
by good dame Teesdale, was always sent as a tithe from the
county to the good Queene Elizabeth, and in this way royal
favor was conferred on this family by the queen, who was delighted
with the wonderful concoction.</p>

<p>Black walnuts and hazel nuts were used in the original
recipe, but as these nuts are quite expensive, the peanuts will do just as well.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg 361]</span>


<h5>CHRISTMAS GOODIES</h5>

<p>In the days of long ago, before the day of heated apartments
and water-heated homes, the housewife used the cellar as
the cold-storage room. To-day this is impossible. For the
householder who has an outside enclosed laundry or summer
kitchen, the problem of keeping the holiday delicacies is quite
an easy one. But to those of us who dwell in flats and apartments,
some other way must be arranged.</p>

<p>Here are two new ideas that are worth trying: First, a
window box on the shady side of the house. This box must be
lined with asbestos paper on the inside, and then covered with
the same paper and an additional covering of oil cloth upon the outside.</p>

<p>By covering the box in this way, the housewife is assured of
a smaller storage space of an even temperature. Neither the
extreme cold nor heat will affect this box. A thick layer of
newspapers may be used as a lining, between the inside covering
of the asbestos and the oil cloth covering upon the outside of the box.</p>

<p>Mincemeat must be stored in a cool, dry place to blend
and ripen, without the danger of freezing. This is also an ideal
time for the mother to plan to have the family help her and at
the same time knit the home ties very closely together. The
home where the family joins in the evening to make the seasonable
delicacies is a very happy one. Let the children have some
of their friends in to help them with the preparations.</p>


<h5>CHICKEN CUSTARD</h5>

<p>Place one pint of chicken stock in a mixing bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One small onion, grated,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>Four eggs.</p>
  </div>  </div>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg 362]</span>

<p>Beat until thoroughly mixed and then fill into well-buttered
glass custard cups and set the cups in a baking pan and fill the
pan half full of warm water. Place in a slow oven to bake until
firm. Remove from the oven and let stand for five minutes to
settle, then loosen the edges of the custard from the cups with
a knife and turn on a slice of toast and serve with parsley
sauce. This is a delicious luncheon dish.</p>

her for this day. However, below are some suggestive menus

<h5>HOW TO PREPARE THE MENU</h5>

<p>Place the oysters in the ice box, near the ice, until ready
to serve. Scrape and clean the celery, cutting the root into a
point, then splitting it in half from root end to tip.</p>

<p>Place in cold water and trim, then cleanse the radishes. Split
the radishes into four parts, from tip to near the stem end;
use a sharp knife for this purpose&mdash;this makes eight cuts in
the radishes. Place in cold water.</p>

<p>Wash the oyster shells and set aside until needed for serving the oysters.</p>


<h5>PLANKED SQUAB</h5>

<p>Split the squab down the back, then draw. Wash well in
cold water and remove the breast bone. Place in a baking pan,
rub with shortening and dust very lightly with the flour. Place
in a hot oven to bake for thirty-five minutes. Baste frequently
with hot water. Now lift to a hot plank and cover with strips
of bacon. Split the sweet potatoes and place on each corner.
Brush lightly with butter, dust with cinnamon and brown sugar.
Place in a hot oven for twelve minutes.</p>


<h5>GUINEA HEN MARIE</h5>

<p>Have the butcher split the hen down the back and remove
the breast bone. Wash and wipe dry, then rub well with shortening
and dust with flour. Lay in a baking pan and place in
a hot oven. Baste every ten minutes with boiling water. Cook
for forty minutes in a moderate oven and just ten minutes before
removing from the oven cover the hen with strips of bacon and</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page368" id="page368"></a>[pg 368]</span>


<h5>GRILLED OYSTERS</h5>

<p>Carefully look over the oyster and remove all bits of shell.
Wash and then roll in mayonnaise, dip in bread crumbs. Return
to the deep shell and broil or bake in a hot oven for ten minutes.</p>


<h5>PASTRY FOR TWO</h5>

<p>Place in a mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of flour,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of baking powder,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Sift to mix, then rub in three tablespoons of shortening and
mix to a dough with three tablespoons of water. Chop the
water into the flour, then turn on the pastry board and roll out
one-quarter inch thick. Use for tarts and turnovers. Brush
with milk or syrup and water and bake in a moderate oven.</p>


<h5>CAKE FOR TWO</h5>

<p>Place in a mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Three-quarters cup of white corn syrup,</p>
<p>Yolk of one egg,</p>
<p>Four tablespoons of water,</p>
<p>One cup of sifted flour,</p>
<p>Three level teaspoons of baking powder,</p>
<p>One level teaspoon of flavoring.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to mix thoroughly and then add two tablespoons of
melted shortening, folding in carefully. When thoroughly
mixed, cut and fold the white of egg into the dough. Turn into
well-greased and floured pan which has a tube in the centre and
bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p>Twenty-five stewing oysters,</p>
<p>Six pound cut of fresh salmon,</p>
<p>One bunch of parsley,</p>

<p>Three large cans of asparagus,</p>
<p>Three firm heads of lettuce,</p>
<p>One can of pimentos,</p>
<p>Two large bottles of catsup,</p>
<p>One small bottle of Worcestershire sauce,</p>
<p>One glass of horseradish,</p>
<p>Six quarts of ice cream, cut five blocks to the quart,</p>
<p>Ten or twelve-pound wedding cake,</p>

and mix well. Add one-half cup of vinegar and mix again, and
use for oyster cocktail, allowing five oysters for each person.</p>

the grilled turkey of New Orleans.</p>

<p>Purchase the white corn syrup and place in a saucepan and
add the cranberries. Bring to a boil and cook slowly for twenty
minutes, and then turn into a bowl to mould. If you wish to
strain out the seeds and skins, rub through a coarse sieve.</p>

bowl in cold water before pouring the jelly in.</p>

<h5>BEVERAGES</h5>

<p>To prepare chocolate as a beverage it is necessary to boil or
cook it thoroughly. The mere fact of pouring boiling water
or milk upon the cocoa will not cook it sufficiently.</p>


<h5>HOW TO PREPARE CHOCOLATE</h5>

<p>The Mexican epicure long ago discovered that to make
chocolate successfully, it is necessary to beat it continually
and he thus perfected a chocolate whip which is a wooden beater
with a number of wooden rings fastened to it; when this is used
to stir the chocolate it churns the mixture to a froth.</p>

<p>The French use a number of switches, bound into a whip.
The American housewife uses a flat wire whip for this purpose.</p>

<p>Cocoa.&mdash;Place in a saucepan three-fourths cup of water and
two level teaspoons of cocoa for each cup of cocoa desired.
Bring to a boil and then cook for five minutes. Beat continually,
then add one-fourth cup of scalded milk for each cup of
cocoa. Bring to a boil again and then serve.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg 386]</span>

<p>Chocolate.&mdash;Use three ounces of chocolate to one quart of
water. Cut the chocolate fine and then add water and stir
constantly. Bring to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Add
one cup of scalded cream and then bring again to boiling point
and serve. One tablespoon of whipped cream may be added to
each cup just before serving.</p>


<h5>HOW TO BREW A CUP OF TEA</h5>

<p>From an old tea merchant in London I received my instructions
for making a perfect cup of tea. First rinse out the teapot
with cold water and then fill it with boiling water, and let
stand while you bring the water intended for the tea to a boil.
Just before the water boils, turn out the water in the teapot and
wipe dry. Then add the tea leaves and pour on the freshly
boiled water. Cover the pot with a tea cosy or wrap in a
towel and let stand exactly seven minutes. The tea is now
ready to drink. This will give you a delicious drink of ambrosia
that will delight the heart of true lovers of a good cup of tea.</p>

<p>The use of a cosy for the teapot is to hold the heat in the
pot and thus prevent quick cooling. Use one level teaspoon of
tea to each one-half pint of water. Measure the water before
boiling. The water must be poured on the tea immediately upon
reaching the boiling point. After boiling for two minutes or
longer the water quickly loses its natural gases.</p>


<h5>COFFEE</h5>

<p>Many varieties abound in the market. Among the best is
the Arabian, with Liberian and Maragogipo closely following.
After the coffee is harvested the quality and the value depend
on the care in curing and packing. Brazil supplies the United
States with about 80 per cent, of all the coffee used. Mexico
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387" id="page387"></a>[pg 387]</span>
and Central America together furnish about 17 per cent., thus
leaving about 3 per cent. from foreign countries.</p>

<p>Various brands of coffee known by the housewife are:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Mocha,</p>
<p>Java,</p>
<p>Rio,</p>
<p>Santa Bourbon,</p>
<p>Santa,</p>
<p>Maracaibo,</p>
<p>Bogota,</p>
<p>Peaberry.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The first named are the most expensive, the last named the
cheapest. The word "blend" when used with coffee means a
mixing of two or more varieties, producing a coffee of various
strengths and of a smooth, mellow flavor.</p>

<p>After the coffee is roasted it should be kept in air-tight cans.
Grinding is the next important step, and this must be just
right to get the full strength. Coffee coarsely ground is not
desirable, as it requires a long time to infuse and is therefore
wasteful. A medium fine grind will be found practical for those
who use the old-style coffee pot. To filter, using the percolator,
the coffee should be quite fine. The water falls continually over
the coffee and produces a uniform cup.</p>

<p>How to make good coffee, using the old-fashioned coffeepot:
Place one level tablespoon of medium finely ground coffee
in the pot for every cup desired; add the water and bring
quickly to the boiling point. Stir with a spoon and then add
a small pinch of salt and four tablespoons of cold water to
settle the grounds. Let it stand in a warm place for five minutes; then serve.</p>

<p>Percolator method: Place three-quarters of a level tablespoon
of finely ground coffee in a percolator for each cup desired.
Add the water and then place the pot on the fire. Let
the coffee filter just four minutes after the first pumping of the
water in the glass top shows a coffee color. This will produce
an even, uniform cup of stimulating beverage.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page388" id="page388"></a>[pg 388]</span>


<h5>COFFEE AU LAIT</h5>

<p>French breakfast coffee: Make the coffee by the method desired,
making only one-half the usual quantity. Now heat to the
boiling point sufficient milk to fill each cup one-half full. When
ready to serve, pour the hot milk in the cup and then fill it with coffee.</p>


<h5>COFFEE NOIR</h5>

<p>This coffee is usually drunk from the demi-tasse. Therefore,
it should be of superior strength, usually one and one-quarter
tablespoons are allowed of very finely ground coffee
for every two cups. It is percolated until the liquid is very
strong and is rich black in color; this takes, usually, from
eight to ten minutes after the coffee first shows its color in the
glass top of the percolator.</p>


<h5>EPICUREAN CREOLE COFFEE</h5>

<p>Many of the old Spanish and French grandees, who were
the forefathers of the Franco-Spanish new world city, New
Orleans, brought with them the beautiful china coffee pot of yesteryear.
The making of the after-dinner coffee was an art indeed.</p>

<p>The pot was filled with hot water and then set in a pail
of boiling water to keep warm while the coffee was milled. Generally
it was roasted fresh every day. It was ground into a
fine flour, then tied in a piece of thin, fine muslin. The water
was drained from the heated pot and the coffee was placed
in it. Then fresh boiling water was poured in. The spout and
top were closely covered with a napkin and the pot returned to
the pail, containing sufficient boiling water to keep the pot hot.
It was placed before the fire to brew; this usually took from
ten to fifteen minutes. The coffee was ready and its delicious
aroma and flavor amply repaid one for the time and trouble taken to make it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page389" id="page389"></a>[pg 389]</span>


<h5>COFFEE A LA CREME</h5>

<p>Coffee made in the usual manner and then served with plain and whipped cream.</p>


<h5>TURKISH COFFEE</h5>

<p>The coffee for this style is ground into a fine flour, and is
then covered with cold water, brought to the boiling point,
sweetened and served without straining or filtering. Russian
coffee is heavy and black and is frequently served with a slice of lemon.</p>


<h5>SUMMER DRINKS</h5>

<p>A cool drink, with plenty of ice tinkling in the glass, refreshes
and invigorates one at the close of a warm day. The
housewife may prepare with little trouble many delicious fruit
flavors from fresh fruits that can be quickly turned into thirst-quenching
beverages, by adding ice and a little carbonated water.</p>

<p>Plain carbonated water may be purchased in either pint
or quart bottles; and if a good cork is used to stop the opening
of the bottles, after removing the caps, it may be used at intervals,
providing it is kept on ice.</p>


<h5>PARISIAN TEA</h5>

<p>Place two teaspoonfuls of tea in a pitcher and pour over
it one cup of boiling water. Cover closely and let stand for one-half
hour. Drain and then place in the ice box until needed.</p>

<p>To serve&mdash;place four tablespoons of the tea infusion in a tall glass and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Juice of one-half lemon,</p>
<p>One-half cup of crushed ice,</p>

<h5>HOW TO PREPARE ICE CREAM</h5>

<p>Prepare the mixture for freezing early in the morning, while
working in the kitchen, and then when it is cool place in the
ice box to be thoroughly chilled until needed. Scald and cool
the can and then place in the refrigerator. When ready to
prepare the cream for freezing, place the ice in a bag and with
a wooden mallet pound it fine. Now pour the prepared mixture
into the cold can and place the dasher in position. Place
the can in the freezer and adjust the turning crank, and give
a few turns of the handle to see that everything is working
easily. Now use a pint bowl for measuring and pour in three
measures of ice, then one of salt. Repeat this until the ice and
salt are above the mixture inside the can. It is necessary to be
accurate if you wish to obtain good results.</p>

<p>Haphazard measuring only means failure. Turn the freezer
until it begins to become difficult to turn, then remove the dasher,
using a wooden spoon to scrape and pack. You must work
quickly, as it is important not to keep the can open any longer
than necessary. Place n cork in the opening in the lid of the
can and cover the top of can with a piece of wax paper, then put on the lid.</p>

<p>Now drain off all the water. Repack, using four parts of
ice to one part salt. Cover closely and set aside for one and
one-half hours to ripen.</p>

<p>If all preparations are made earlier in the day, it will take
about one-half hour to put together the mixture and make the cream.</p>

<p>Frozen desserts are divided into two classes, ices and ice
creams. The ices include sherbets, water ices, frapp&#233;s and
sorbets. Ice creams include Philadelphia cream, American and
French creams, parfaits and mousses. Sherbets contain gelatin
or whites of eggs and water-ice mixture. Water ices are fruit
juices sweetened and diluted with water. Frappes are partially
frozen water ices. Sorbet is a mixture of flavors prepared as
for water ices or a frozen punch.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page394" id="page394"></a>[pg 394]</span>


<h3>ICE CREAM</h3>

<p>Philadelphia ice cream is made from thin sweetened cream.
American ice cream is a mixture of thin cream and a custard
well flavored, which is then frozen. Frequently junket preparations
are used in this cream. French ice cream is a plain, frozen,
rich custard. Parfaits are creams made from a thick syrup,
egg yolks and whipped cream, packed in a mould and frozen.</p>

<p>Mousses are heavy creams flavored and sweetened and then
whipped, packed into a mould and frozen.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the can must not be over two-thirds
full. All creams in the making increase in volume and
therefore they must have sufficient room for churning. See that
all parts of the freezer work freely before starting. If rusty
or stiff use a drop or two of salad oil and then turn until it works freely.</p>




<h4>RECIPES</h4>


<h5>1 GAL.&mdash;PEACH ICE CREAM</h5>

<p>Pare and cut in thin slices one quart of peaches and then

through a fine sieve, add to the prepared custard and freeze in the usual manner.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page395" id="page395"></a>[pg 395]</span>


<h5>STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM</h5>

<p>Wash and stem one pint of berries. Crush, using a potato
masher. Cover with one cup of sugar and then let stand for
one-half hour. Rub through a sieve into a bowl and place in
the ice box until needed. Now place in a saucepan.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<h5>FROZEN STRAWBERRY CUSTARD</h5>

<p>A small two-quart freezer will make sufficient for the ordinary
family at a very small outlay. It will require about ten
pounds of ice and one and one-quarter pounds of salt. Break
the ice very fine and use a bowl to measure with. Allow three
parts of the ice to one part of salt for the freezing mixture
and four parts of ice to one part salt for the packing mixture.</p>

<p>Make a custard by placing three cups of milk in a saucepan
and adding one-half cup of cornstarch. Dissolve the starch

<h4>DIET TO REDUCE WEIGHT</h4>


<p>Correct eating is essential to health and because of this
the proper cooking and serving of food plays an important part,
in either the building up or reducing of weight to a desired average.</p>

<p>As a rule, stout people seldom realize that they are eating
food that, is entirely unsuited to them; and not only do they
love starchy and over-rich foods, but also they frequently consume
a liberal portion of sweets.</p>

<p>Now unwise eating seldom produces its effects at once.
When noticed, the body is already burdened with heavy layers
of fat, that not only cause their bearer to be distressed and uncomfortable,
but also cause disease.</p>

<p>Not all of us can eat every food that is put before us, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400" id="page400"></a>[pg 400]</span>
we can so arrange our menus that we will be able to balance the
diet and in this way supply the body with just its required needs.</p>

<p>Eating over-large portions of rich desserts, fatty foods and
starchy products causes these foods to turn into a fatty tissue,
and then be stored in the body as adipose tissue. So, in order
to get good results, the person who wishes to reduce should learn
to thoroughly chew all foods. By this I mean chew the food
very fine, so that it will be thoroughly mixed with the saliva and
then flow without much effort to the stomach.</p>

<p>You know that all starchy foods are changed by the action
of the saliva into invert sugars; they then go to the stomach
where they are thoroughly diluted with gastric juices and finally
passed into the intestines, where the final processes of digestion take place.</p>

<p>This form of starch is stored by the liver and kidneys, and
thus passes out to the various tissues to be held in the body as fat.</p>

<p>To reduce this fleshy tissue it is necessary to prevent the
storage of more sugars, starches and fats in the body, and
to cause that which is already stored there to be gradually consumed
to prevent starving.</p>

<p>Many people who go on a diet for reducing flesh in a few
days complain of great, weariness, exhaustion and gnawing
hunger in the pit of the stomach. A diet that cuts down the
supply of food with the intention of reducing is extremely dangerous
unless it is supervised by a physician. But persons who
wish to make a visible reduction of flesh in a time ranging from
five to six weeks can do so, if they will learn the foods that cause
and feed these flesh-forming tissues and learn to replace this
with non-fat-forming foods.</p>

<p>And summer time is an ideal time to accomplish a reduction
of flesh for those who wish to try it.</p>

<h5>WHAT THESE BREAKFASTS ELIMINATE</h5>

<p>The sugar and cream from fruit and coffee and the butter
from the toast&mdash;all of which are fat-forming foods. Toasting
bread dexterizes the starch and thus helps the digestion of this starchy product.</p>

<p>Breakfast may be eaten from 7 to 8.30 <span class="sc">A.M</span>., and is so balanced
that those who board or take their meals in restaurants
may easily follow the diet. Now, during the warm weather,
it is most important to eat lightly during the noon period, and
for this reason a light luncheon will be provided. Those who are
employed in sedentary occupations should partake of a milk and
<i>egg</i> shake, or chocolate egg and milk; and this will be sufficient

<p>This meal eliminates potatoes, butter and the rich heavy
desserts. The portions should be about three ounces of lean
meat and one-half cup of each vegetable, three leaves of lettuce.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page406" id="page406"></a>[pg 406]</span>
Use French dressing on all salads and one-half cup of fruit for dessert.</p>

<p>This amount of food will not only satisfy, but also will, if
persisted in, give satisfactory results in a reduction of flesh.
This means that you cannot eat candy and other sweets between
meals, and if you feel that you must have something sweet, try
a piece of chewing gum. If fruits are too sour, try corn syrup
for sweetening; about one-half cup to each quart of prepared
fruit. Fresh fruits develop their own natural sweetness if they
are baked instead of stewed in a saucepan. Just place them in a
casserole dish with this amount of syrup or plain water and
bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes.</p>


<h5>CINNAMON TOAST</h5>

<p>Place two ounces of butter in a bowl and cream well. Add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Five tablespoons of sugar,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of  cinnamon extract or powdered cinnamon.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cream and then spread on nicely toasted bread.</p>




<h4>FRIED OYSTERS</h4>


<p>Unless the oyster is attractive in appearance, single dipped
and fried an attractive brown, it is a failure as a fried oyster;
few housewives seem to be able to turn out a perfect product.</p>

<p>Use large oysters, and look them over carefully for bits of
shell. Wash and then roll in highly seasoned corn flour. Let
dry off for ten minutes and then dip in prepared egg, and then
roll in fine bread crumbs. Stand aside to dry for ten minutes.
Fry only three or four at a time in hot fat. Care must be
taken to have the fat sufficiently hot. Usually about 370 degrees Fahrenheit will do.</p>

<p>If you do not use a fat thermometer to test the fat, then
try it with a piece of bread in the following manner: Place a
crust of bread in the fat and begin to count 101, 102, 103, 104,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page407" id="page407"></a>[pg 407]</span>
etc., until you reach 110: the bread should then be a deep
golden brown. Then proceed to fry the oysters, keeping the
fact in mind that more than three or four in at once will reduce
the temperature of the fat and thus permit the oyster to soak up the grease.</p>

<p>The oyster is one of our most democratic luxuries; it is in
very high favor in our most luxurious restaurants, and yet it is
held in equal esteem in our most moderate-priced lunch rooms.
Oysters are sold both in and out of the shell, fresh and canned,
and they may be eaten and cooked in almost every conceivable way.</p>

<p>Among the best known varieties are blue point, Buzzard
Bays, Cape Cods, Lynnhavens, Maurice Rivers, Rockaways,
saddle rocks, sea tags, Shrewsberrys and coruits and Oak
Creeks. Many of these titles have really lost their real significance
by trade misuses. Blue points, for example, is often,
though incorrectly, applied to all small oysters, irrespective of their source.</p>

<p>The oyster season opens in September and continues on
until May. Three sizes are usually recognized by the trade&mdash;half
shells, the smallest culls, the medium size and the box, which
is the largest. True oyster lovers really prefer the large Lynnhavens
and others on the deep shell.</p>

<p>The epicure delights in eating raw oysters; and while this
satisfies his appetite, it is also understood that the raw oyster
virtually is assimilated without taxing the digestion.</p>

<p>Oysters may be found in almost all parts of the civilized
world, each locality having its own special species.</p>

<p>It is a universal custom to omit the oyster from the bill of
fare during the months of May, June, July and August. We
have in their places the salt oyster and the clam.</p>

<p>Oysters may be served on either the deep or flat shell, on a
bed of finely crushed ice with a slice of lemon, Worcestershire
sauce, catsup, horseradish or tabasco sauce. Nice crisp celery
and toasted crackers generally accompany raw oysters. Do
not, under any circumstances, cover the oyster with ice. Oysters
may be made into cocktails or may be frozen.</p>

small oysters per person.</p>


<h5>FRAPPE OYSTERS</h5>

<p>Place oysters in freezer and freeze until soft mush, and then

<h5>SWEET POTATOES</h5>

<p>Sweet potatoes are the roots or tubes of a vine-like plant;
it is a native of tropical climate, but it is grown in states as
far north as New York. The delicious yams of the southern
states and the West Indies are made into many attractive
foods. The food value of the sweet potato is closely allied to
that of the white potato, but it contains from 4 to 10 per cent.
sugar, where the ordinary white potato has no sugar. And,
then, too, this common vegetable will provide a variety of delectable dishes.</p>


<h5>SWEET POTATO CROQUETTES</h5>

<p>Wash and cook the potatoes until tender. Use six large
sweet potatoes. Drain, cool and peel. Mash fine and then place in a bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of butter,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of pepper.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mould into croquettes and then dip in beaten egg and then
in fine crumbs and fry golden brown in hot fat. Serve with cheese sauce.</p>


<h5>SWEET POTATO NESTS</h5>

<p>Cook sweet potatoes and peel and mash and then form into
nests. Place the nests on a well-greased baking dish and fill
with creamed dried beef. Place in the oven for ten minutes and
heat. Sprinkle with grated cheese.</p>

<p>Sweet potatoes may be used for a border for stews, for goulashes,
etc. Try this method of baking the potato: Wash well,
scrubbing with a vegetable brush. Dry and then grease thoroughly
and place in oven to bake. This method prevents a
thick coarse skin from forming with the pulp attached to it.</p>

<h4>CORN</h4>


<p>Nowhere do they cook corn as tender as it is usually prepared
in the corn belt. Select full, well-shaped ears of corn and remove
the husk, leaving just the last layer. Now fold back this layer
of husk and remove all the silk from the corn, using a stiff vegetable
brush for this purpose. Refold the husk about the corn and cook it.</p>

<p>How to cook the corn: Have a large kettle containing plenty
of boiling water. Add one teaspoon of sugar, add corn and
boil twelve minutes for small ears and fifteen to eighteen minutes
for large ears; cover pot closely.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page424" id="page424"></a>[pg 424]</span>


<h5>TO DRY CORN&mdash;LANCASTER COUNTY RECIPE</h5>

<p>Select firm, full ears of corn and husk. Remove the silk
with a cloth and then plunge the ears of corn into boiling water
and cook for five minutes. Remove and dip in cold water and
then cut from the cob with a sharp knife. Spread on shallow
trays and dry in a commercial or homemade drier.</p>

<p>This corn may be dried in the oven at a temperature of about
110 degrees Fahrenheit. Leave the oven door open so that the
moisture may quickly evaporate.</p>

<p>The Lancaster county farmers dry this corn in the sun and
cover the trays with mosquito netting; they are brought in at
night to protect them from the dampness and dew, which would
start a mould on the corn while it is drying.</p>


<h5>CORN FRITTERS FOR TWO PEOPLE</h5>

<p>One half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of pepper.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Beat to thoroughly mix and then either fry in hot fat or bake on a griddle.</p>


<h5>SALTED CORN</h5>

<p>Remove the husk from the corn, leaving just a single layer
against the corn: fold back this single layer of husk and remove
all the silk, wiping with a dry cloth. Place two inches of salt
in the bottom of a deep crock and stand the ears so that each
one will be entirely alone and encased in salt. Stand the tip
end down, pack closely with salt and place two-inch layer on top
Cover and place in a cool place. It is most important that the ears do not touch.</p>

<h5>MAKING SCRAPPLE AND HOGSHEAD CHEESE</h5>

<p>When the family is small, thrifty women usually make the
scrapple and hogshead cheese at the same time. Have the
butcher select for you a nice hogshead; split and then remove
the eyes, brains and tongue. Now scald and cleanse well, rinsing
in plenty of cold water. Place in a preserving kettle and add
just sufficient cold water to cover the head. Now add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two onions,</p>
<p>Two cloves,</p>
<p>One bunch of pot or soup herbs,</p>

a colander in a large bowl or pan and turn in the head. Measure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page434" id="page434"></a>[pg 434]</span>
the liquid and return to the pot. Now remove the bones from
the head and chop sufficient meat very fine to measure three
cups and set aside for making the scrapple.</p>

<p>Cut the balance of the meat into pieces about one inch square
and place two cups of the stock in a small saucepan. Add</p>

<p>Bring to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Add the head
meat that has been cut into the inch pieces.</p>

<p>Rinse loaf-shaped pans with cold water, pour in the cheese
and set aside in a cool place to mould. Use the same as cold
cuts of meat with mustard or horseradish sauce.</p>

<p>Mix and add very slowly, stirring constantly. When it is
sufficiently thick to hold the spoon upright, rinse the baking
pan with cold water and then pour in the scrapple. Set aside
for twenty-four hours to mould. This can be used for breakfast
by cutting into slices and frying a crisp brown or made into croquettes,
rolled in flour and nicely brown in hot fat. Serve with tomato sauce.</p>

<h5>SAUERKRAUT</h5>

bottom of a small barrel or wooden bucket with the outside

salt over the top and cover with large cabbage leaves and then
with a cheese-cloth wrung out of salt water. Tuck in the ends
carefully and then place board on the kraut and weight it down with a heavy stone.</p>

<p>Now, it is necessary that the cabbage be covered with brine;
remove the scum as it rises to the top. The kraut will be ready
for use in six weeks and it must be kept in a very cool place or it must be canned.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Eight quarts of water,</p>

with a piece of clean cheese-cloth and then place on it a board
which is weighted down on top, to keep the cauliflower covered
in the brine. This weight need not be as heavy as that used for the kraut.</p>

<p>Cauliflower prepared in this manner late in October and
November can be used for the table by freshening it in water
and cooking in a manner similar to that in which the salted beans
are cooked, or it may be canned in three months, when there
will be a supply of fruit jars.</p>

<p>To can the brined cauliflower, remove from the brine and
wash in cold running water. Let stand for one hour and then
fill into the sterilized jars; fill jars with boiling water; adjust
the rubbers and lids and partially seal. Place in a hot-water
bath and process for one hour. Remove, seal securely and then
cool and store in a cool, dry place.</p>

leaves, and then trim into shape. Now place a layer of salt one
inch deep in the bottom of the keg or crock and then place the

<h5>QUINCES</h5>

<p>The quince is the fruit of a tree of the apple and pear
family, and a true native of southern Europe and Asia. It is
cultivated in all temperate climates.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks and Romans accredited the quince with
many healing powers. There is a legend of a beautiful Grecian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page449" id="page449"></a>[pg 449]</span>
maid who discovered the true secret of making marmalade, and
this was afterward served by maids of Athens to their sweethearts
after the conquests.</p>

<p>The name marmalade is from the Portuguese, which is marmelo.</p>

<p>The quince is a fruit that cannot be eaten in its raw state,
but is most delicious in jam, jelly marmalade and quince
butter, and vies with apple and guava as the best fruit for jelly making.</p>

<p>The large, smooth fruit is the first choice, and it must be
carefully handled as it bruises quickly; parts which are bruised
very rapidly discolor to a dark brown. To keep the quinces
any length of time, wipe them frequently with a dry cloth, and
set on a wire tray so that there may be a free circulation of
air around the place, and place in a cool, dry and well-ventilated room.</p>

<p>The seeds of the quince are rich in a mucilage-like matter,
and they form a jelly-like paste when soaked in water.</p>


<h5>FANCY QUINCE MARMALADE</h5>

<p>Prepare the quinces as for Roman quince marmalade and
measure the fruit. To four quarts of cooked quinces and juice add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One package of seedless raisins,</p>
<p>One medium-sized bottle of maraschino cherries, cut into tiny bits,</p>
<p>Two cups of finely chopped almonds or other nuts,</p>
<p>Two and one-half quarts of granulated sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in the preserving kettle and bring to a boil. Cook
slowly until a thick marmalade and then fill into sterilized jars.
Adjust the rubber and lid and seal. Process in a hot water bath
for fifteen minutes and then store in a cool, dry place.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page450" id="page450"></a>[pg 450]</span>


<h5>QUINCE JELLY</h5>

<p>Wash the quinces and then cut in half, and remove the seeds
and cores and pare. Cut the pared quince in thin slices and then
place in a bowl and cover with cold water.</p>

<p>Place the parings and seeds of the quinces in a preserving
kettle, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook
until the parings are very soft. Mash frequently and turn into
a jelly bag, and let drip.</p>

<p>Measure the quince juice or liquid and return it to the preserving
kettle. Bring to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Then
add three-quarters cup of sugar for each cup of juice. Stir to
thoroughly dissolve the sugar and then bring to a boil and cook
for ten minutes. Pour into sterilized glasses. Cool and cover
with melted paraffin and store in the usual manner for jellies.</p>

<p>Now place the quinces which were cut into thin slices and
cover with cold water in the preserving kettle, covering the sliced
quinces with water two inches above the fruit in the kettle. Bring
to a boil and then cook slowly until the sliced quinces are soft.
Drain off the juice and then measure the cooked fruit. Return to the kettle and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One quart of sugar,</p>
<p>One cup of water</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>to every three quarts of cooked sliced quinces. Place on stove
and cook slowly until a very thick jam. Fill in sterilized jars
and adjust the rubber and lid and seal. Process in hot water
bath for fifteen minutes and then cool and store.</p>

<p>Use the liquid strained from the cooked quinces for jelly,
following the rule for quince jelly.</p>


<h5>ROMAN QUINCE MARMALADE</h5>

<p>Wash the quinces, and then pare and cut into thin slices.
Place in a preserving kettle and cover with cold water. Place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page451" id="page451"></a>[pg 451]</span>
on the stove and cook until tender. Now place the parings,
cores and seeds in a separate kettle and cover with cold water.
Bring to a boil and cook slowly until the pulp is very soft.
Strain and add this liquid to the quinces which are cooking.
Cook the quinces until very soft. Then mash through a fine sieve.</p>

<p>Now measure this crushed pulp and juice and return to the
preserving kettle. Bring to a boil and cook for fifteen minutes,
and add two-thirds quart of sugar for every quart of the prepared
quince pulp. Stir the sugar until it dissolves and then
bring to a boil, and cook slowly until the mixture is a thick
jam. Pour into sterilized glasses or bowls and cool. Cover with melted paraffin.</p>

<p>This Roman quince marmalade was accredited with the
power to heal coughs and colds.</p>


<h5>QUINCE CHIPS</h5>

<p>Wash and pare one dozen quinces, and then cut into quarters
and remove the cores. Now cut into thin slices and place in a
preserving kettle, and cover with cold water. Cook until tender
and then cover the parings, cores and seeds with cold water,
and cook until very soft. Strain off the liquid and return this
liquid to the preserving kettle and boil to reduce to two cups;
then add four pounds of sugar. Stir to thoroughly dissolve
the sugar and then boil until it forms a thread when tested
from the prongs of a fork. Now add the well-drained quinces
that have been cooked until they are tender, and let the mixture
simmer for two hours.</p>

<p>Remove the kettle and set aside overnight. The next morning
reheat the quinces and let boil for two hours.</p>

<p>Set aside for twenty-four hours and repeat for three days.
Turn into a sieve or put through a colander to drain. When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page452" id="page452"></a>[pg 452]</span>
well drained and nearly dry, separate each piece of quince and
roll in granulated sugar. Let dry in a warm room and then
pack into boxes lined with wax paper. Place wax paper between
the layers. The liquor drained from the quinces may be placed
in glasses and stored for quince jelly. This delicious Greek confection
was served at banquets and on all gala occasions.</p>


<h5>BEEF CROQUETTES</h5>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cups of finely cooked beef,</p>
<p>One cup of very thick cream sauce,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of paprika,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce,</p>
<p>One-quarter teaspoon of mustard,</p>
<p>Two tablespoons of grated onion.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix thoroughly and then form into croquettes and roll
lightly in flour. Dip in beaten egg and then in fine crumbs, and
fry until golden brown in hot fat.</p>


<h5>SPANISH STEAK</h5>

<p>Have the butcher cut two pounds from either the round or
the chuck steak and then wipe with a damp cloth. Now pat
well with flour and lay on a baking dish. Place in a hot oven
and baste every ten minutes, using about one cup of boiling
water. Cook for twenty minutes and then add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One cup of sliced onions,</p>
<p>One cup of well-drained tomatoes.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Return to the oven and bake for fifteen minutes and then
remove and season with salt and paprika and four tablespoons
of grated cheese. Return to the oven for five minutes.</p>


<h5>JUST A PIG'S HEAD AND SET OF FEET</h5>

<p>Have the butcher split the head and then cleanse, removing
the brain and tongue. Discard the eyes. Then wash in plenty
of cold water and cleanse thoroughly. Place the head, feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page453" id="page453"></a>[pg 453]</span>
and tongue in a large preserving kettle and cover with cold water and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cups of sliced onions,</p>
<p>Two carrots, cut in dice,</p>
<p>One and one-half cups of dried celery leaves,</p>
<p>One-half ounce of celery seed,</p>
<p>One-half ounce of mustard seed,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of thyme,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of sage,</p>
<p>One tablespoon of sweet marjoram,</p>
<p>One dozen whole allspice,</p>
<p>One bunch of potherbs.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and skim frequently and cook until the meat
on the head and feet is tender. Remove the head, feet and
tongue and boil the liquid for ten minutes to reduce. Strain and
then measure. To two and one-half quarts of this stock add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of black pepper,</p>
<p>Three tablespoons of salt,</p>
<p>Two cups of oatmeal,</p>
<p>Three cups of cornmeal,</p>
<p>One cup of whole-wheat flour,</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>and then meat, chopped fine from the set of pig's feet. Cook
slowly, stirring frequently. Cook until very thick, like mush, on
the back part of the range, and then rinse a square loaf-shaped
pan with cold water. Pour in the scrapple and then place the
balance of the stock, three pints, in a preserving kettle and add
one cup of vinegar. Bring to a boil and cook for fifteen minutes
to reduce. Add the meat, removed from the head and cut
into neat pieces. Rinse a loaf-shaped pan with cold water, and
then pour in the mince. Set in a cool place to mould.</p>

<p>The scrapple may be formed into croquettes and dipped in
flour and fried until golden brown, or it may be cut into thin
slices and fried in the usual manner. Cut the head cheese in
slices and serve with mustard sauce.</p>

<p>Cook the brains for breakfast or luncheon.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page454" id="page454"></a>[pg 454]</span>




<h4>CANDY</h4>


<h5>TO MELT CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING</h5>

<p>Either the plain or sweet chocolate may be used for dipping.
To prevent streaking or turning gray, the chocolate must be
melted at a low temperature, so fill the lower part of the double
boiler with boiling water. Place the top compartment in position,
then add the chocolate which has been cut fine. Add one
tablespoon of salad oil to each half-pound. Stir frequently
until the chocolate melts and then dip in the fondant centres,
nuts or pieces of candied fruit. Place to dry on a board which
has been covered with oil cloth.</p>


<h5>GINGER CRYSTALS</h5>

<p>Soak three level tablespoons of gelatine in one-half cup of
cold water for one hour. Then place in a saucepan that is free from grease</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of sugar,</p>
<p>One cup of water.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Bring to a boil and cook for five minutes, then add the prepared
gelatine. Stir to dissolve thoroughly, then bring to a boil
again and cook for twelve minutes. Remove from the fire and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One tablespoon of lemon juice,</p>
<p>Two-thirds cup of crystallized ginger, cut in tiny bits.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Rinse an oblong pan with cold water and drain well. Turn
in the cooked mixture and set in a cool place for twelve hours
to become firm. Then loosen from the pan and remove. Turn
on the table and cut into blocks. Roll in granulated sugar and
let stand to crystallize.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page455" id="page455"></a>[pg 455]</span>


<h5>BON-BONS</h5>

<p>The first thing to do is to prepare the fondant, which is
easily done if you own a candy thermometer. Just place in a
saucepan that is absolutely free from grease</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two cups of granulated sugar,</p>
<p>One-fourth cup of white corn syrup,</p>
<p>One-half cup of boiling water,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of cream of tartar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Adjust candy thermometer to side of saucepan.</p>

<p>Set in a warm place for a few minutes to melt the sugar
and then stir well. Wipe the sides of the saucepan with a damp
cloth to remove the sugar crystals. Place the saucepan on the
stove and bring to a boil. Cook until it reaches 240 degrees on
the candy thermometer. Remove from the stove. Pour on well
oiled meat platter and let cool. When cool, work to a creamy
mass and then knead like bread dough. Place in a bowl and let
stand for one day to ripen in a cool place. Cover bowl with a
cloth that has been wrung very dry from hot water. This fondant
may be used between halves of English walnuts, as centres
for chocolates or to cover almonds or pieces of fruit. It can
also be used for dipping and making bon-bons.</p>


<h5>SUGARLESS CANDY</h5>

<p>This fruit paste is the invention of an old Italian fruit merchant
who specialized years ago in crystallized fruits. Put through the food chopper</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-quarter pound of cocoanut,</p>
<p>One-half pound of seedless raisins,</p>
<p>One-half pound dates, figs,</p>
<p>One pound shelled nuts, add two tablespoons syrup, form in balls and oblongs.</p>
  </div>  </div>


<h5>TO USE FONDANT FOR DIPPING</h5>

<p>Place one-half of the fondant in the top part of a double
boiler and fill the lower part with boiling water. Add about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page456" id="page456"></a>[pg 456]</span>
one tablespoon of boiling water to the fondant and stir continually
to reduce to a thick cream. Dip in the pieces of nut,
candied fruit or balls of plain-flavored fondant. Let dry on
waxed paper or oil cloth covered board.</p>

<p>When the fondant becomes too dry for further dipping,
scrape from the pan, using a wooden spoon and form into
balls. Dip them in melted chocolate.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half pound of shelled peanuts,</p>
<p>One-half pound of prunes,</p>
<p>One-half pound of apricots,</p>
<p>One-half pound of citron.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Mix and form into balls or cylinders. Roll in finely chopped
cocoanut or finely chopped nuts; or line a tin box, such as
the sugar wafers come in, with wax paper, and then fill with the
fruit mixture. Press hard to make it firm and let stand for four
hours. Remove from the box and cut in half-inch slices.</p>

<p>A box packed with an assortment of these delicious homemade
candies will make a very desirable present.</p>

water, usually about ten minutes. Drain and then cover with
a cloth to make mealy. Then roll in melted butter and sprinkle
with finely chopped parsley.</p>

Chicken guinea hen, duck, geese, squabs or baby pig and any

before and then set in the ice box until needed. Use a prepared
breakfast cereal, such as corn flakes, etc. This eliminates cooking the cereal.</p>

<h5>MENUS FOR THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY</h5>

<p>Planning a real, old-fashioned watch party to see the old
year out and the new one in will afford a real entertainment.
Have the folks arrive about 10 o'clock and then pass an hour
and a half in dancing, singing and generally having a real good
old-fashioned time. Then about 11.45 serve the supper, so that
just before midnight all are ready with a toast to the new year.</p>

<p>Arrange so that each guest is in his place standing, with
a wassail cup in hand, and then at three minutes of 12, darken
the room. When 12 o'clock is struck, turn on the lights and drink a Happy New Year.</p>

<p>New Year merrymaking is as old as the history of England.
There the head of the house assembles the family around the
wassail bowl to drink the healths of every one. The Saxon
phrase "Wasshael" means "Your health"; hence the wassail
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page477" id="page477"></a>[pg 477]</span>
bowl. In many of the shires and counties the lads and lassies
secure a large bowl and ornament it with ribbons and artificial
flowers, and, with this visit the gentry, all the while singing
songs suitable to the occasion.</p>


<h5>AN ENGLISH WASSAIL</h5>

<p>Place two gallons of cider in a large punch bowl and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>A large lump of ice,</p>
<p>One-half dozen bananas, cut in thin slices,</p>
<p>One-half dozen oranges, cut in slices and then in small pieces,</p>
<p>One medium-sized bottle of maraschino cherries,</p>
<p>Small baked apple.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Cut the cherries into tiny bits and use the juice also. Put
in one baked apple for each guest. The apples are afterward
eaten with a fork. Mix and serve.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions for supper:</p>

<h5>COD BASSLANO</h5>

<p>The serving of a fish entree with the Sunday dinner gives
just the right zest to the meal. Select two slices of cod or
other sliced fish. Cut into small fillets and season and then
roll in flour. Dip in beaten egg and then roll in fine bread
crumbs. Fry until golden brown in hot fat and serve with tartare sauce.</p>


<h5>ROAST LOIN OF PORK</h5>

<p>Select a five- or six-pound cut and have the butcher remove
the entire chine bone. Wipe and place in a baking pan and pat
in one cup of flour. Core one apple for each service and place
meat in the hot oven. Let brown and then reduce the heat and
allow one-half hour for the meat to the pound to cook in a
moderate oven. Baste with boiling water.</p>


<h5>CRANBERRY DUMPLINGS</h5>

<p>Chop two cups of cranberries very fine and add</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of seedless raisins,</p>
<p>One cup of brown sugar.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Place in the mixing bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One and one-half cups of flour,</p>
<p>One-half teaspoon of salt,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of baking powder.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stiffen to mix and then rub in three tablespoons of shortening
and work to a dough with one-half cup of cold water. Roll
out one-quarter inch thick and spread with cranberry mixture.
Roll like for jelly roll and then wrap in a pudding cloth. Plunge
in a saucepan containing boiling water; cook for forty minutes
and then lift and drain. Serve, cut in inch-wide slices with
sweetened cranberry sauce.</p>

<p>Many persons like the old-fashioned idea of entertaining
on New Year's Day with a real old-time dinner. An ideal number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page480" id="page480"></a>[pg 480]</span>
is either eight or twelve persons. Put the full quota of
leaves in the dining-room table and pad it nicely. Cover with
your best table cloth. A miniature tree or a bush of mistletoe
or holly for a centre-piece is both seasonable and appropriate.</p>

<p>To serve this meal with one maid, it must be arranged so
as to relieve her of the waitress tasks. Mould the butter into
balls and arrange the service, allowing at least twenty-two
inches between the guests. Place the celery and relish in glass
dishes at intervals along the side of the table and serve the salad with the dinner.</p>

<h5>RECIPES FOR TWELVE PERSONS</h5>

<p>Strain the juice of fifty stewing oysters, then look them
over carefully and remove all bits of shell. Wash and then
place in a saucepan and add two tablespoons of butter. Now
place in a large saucepan</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Four pints of milk,</p>
<p>One pint of oyster liquid,</p>
<p>One-half cup of flour.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Stir to dissolve the flour thoroughly and then bring quickly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page481" id="page481"></a>[pg 481]</span>
to a boil. Bring the oysters quickly to the scalding point; add to the milk with</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two tablespoons of finely minced parsley,</p>
<p>One teaspoon of grated onion,</p>
<p>One and one-half teaspoons of salt,</p>

<p>Let simmer slowly for a few minutes. Serve with old-fashioned water crackers.</p>


<h5>ROAST BEEF YORKSHIRE PUDDING</h5>

<p>Select a fancy prime cut from a young steer and have the
butcher cut off the chine and trim for roasting. Place in a baking
pan without seasoning. Place in lowest part of the broiling
oven. Cook, allowing fifteen minutes to the pound. Turn the
meat every fifteen minutes and baste with its own fat.</p>

<p>Cooking the meat before the flame gives it the flavor and
appearance of the old-time open-fire roasting.</p>

<p>About twenty minutes before serving the meal, place one-half
cup of the drippings from the roasting pan in a baking
pan and place in the oven to heat. While heating, prepare the
pudding. Place in a bowl</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Two and one-half cups of milk,</p>
<p>Two eggs.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page482" id="page482"></a>[pg 482]</span>
in a hot oven for twenty minutes, basting three times with the
drippings from the roast.</p>

<p>Add the flour to the pan in which the meat was roasted.
Brown well and add three cups of cold water, salt and pepper
to taste. Bring to the boiling point and cook for a few minutes, then serve.</p>

<p>Some people like English horseradish sauce with the roast
meat. And they serve the gravy over the pudding. Place in a saucepan.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>One-half cup of water,</p>
<p>One-half cup of white vinegar,</p>

<h5>FOR EIGHT COUPLES</h5>

<p>In English communities it is the custom to sit up and watch
the departing year out and to welcome in the new. The farmers
in the north country visit the orchards, while the folk in the
highlands visit and return calls.</p>

<p>The custom of New Year's calling is very old indeed, and
in the years of long ago the Beau Brummels and dandies of the
times enjoyed the New Year's calling as a very rare sport.</p>

<p>The mummers who are abroad this day follow the ancient
custom of dear old Scotland, where these rites have prevailed for many centuries.</p>

<p>Toast the old year out and new one in with a loving cup:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Ring out the old with all its hate,</p>
<p>Ring in the new with love and cheer,</p>
<p>Ring on, oh bells of time;</p>
<p>Ring with joy, ere ye be too late.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>To prepare a loving cup for welcoming the new year for fifteen persons:</p>

I give my icings, fillings, pies and puddings
"<i>that chocolaty taste</i>" of Runkel's without bothering
to grate chocolate. Runkel's All-Purpose Cocoa
is the finest quality chocolate, <i>already a powder, all ready to use</i>!</p>

<p>You need no special recipes. Just use three level
tablespoonfuls (&#190; oz.) of Runkel's All-Purpose Cocoa
instead of each "square" (1 oz.) of cooking chocolate.
It not only improves the flavor, but saves &#188; the cost.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
